							<h2><a name="link2H_4_0002" id="link2H_4_0002"></a> Introductory Chapter</h2>

							<p>
								Amongst the novel objects that attracted my attention during my stay in the
								United States, nothing struck me more forcibly than the general equality of
								conditions. I readily discovered the prodigious influence which this primary
								fact exercises on the whole course of society, by giving a certain direction to
								public opinion, and a certain tenor to the laws; by imparting new maxims to the
								governing powers, and peculiar habits to the governed. I speedily perceived
								that the influence of this fact extends far beyond the political character and
								the laws of the country, and that it has no less empire over civil society than
								over the Government; it creates opinions, engenders sentiments, suggests the
								ordinary practices of life, and modifies whatever it does not produce. The more
								I advanced in the study of American society, the more I perceived that the
								equality of conditions is the fundamental fact from which all others seem to be
								derived, and the central point at which all my observations constantly
								terminated.
							</p>

							<p>
								I then turned my thoughts to our own hemisphere, where I imagined that I
								discerned something analogous to the spectacle which the New World presented to
								me. I observed that the equality of conditions is daily progressing towards
								those extreme limits which it seems to have reached in the United States, and
								that the democracy which governs the American communities appears to be rapidly
								rising into power in Europe. I hence conceived the idea of the book which is
								now before the reader.
							</p>

							<p>
								It is evident to all alike that a great democratic revolution is going on
								amongst us; but there are two opinions as to its nature and consequences. To
								some it appears to be a novel accident, which as such may still be checked; to
								others it seems irresistible, because it is the most uniform, the most ancient,
								and the most permanent tendency which is to be found in history. Let us
								recollect the situation of France seven hundred years ago, when the territory
								was divided amongst a small number of families, who were the owners of the soil
								and the rulers of the inhabitants; the right of governing descended with the
								family inheritance from generation to generation; force was the only means by
								which man could act on man, and landed property was the sole source of power.
								Soon, however, the political power of the clergy was founded, and began to
								exert itself: the clergy opened its ranks to all classes, to the poor and the
								rich, the villein and the lord; equality penetrated into the Government through
								the Church, and the being who as a serf must have vegetated in perpetual
								bondage took his place as a priest in the midst of nobles, and not infrequently
								above the heads of kings.
							</p>

							<p>
								The different relations of men became more complicated and more numerous as
								society gradually became more stable and more civilized. Thence the want of
								civil laws was felt; and the order of legal functionaries soon rose from the
								obscurity of the tribunals and their dusty chambers, to appear at the court of
								the monarch, by the side of the feudal barons in their ermine and their mail.
								Whilst the kings were ruining themselves by their great enterprises, and the
								nobles exhausting their resources by private wars, the lower orders were
								enriching themselves by commerce. The influence of money began to be
								perceptible in State affairs. The transactions of business opened a new road to
								power, and the financier rose to a station of political influence in which he
								was at once flattered and despised. Gradually the spread of mental
								acquirements, and the increasing taste for literature and art, opened chances
								of success to talent; science became a means of government, intelligence led to
								social power, and the man of letters took a part in the affairs of the State.
								The value attached to the privileges of birth decreased in the exact proportion
								in which new paths were struck out to advancement. In the eleventh century
								nobility was beyond all price; in the thirteenth it might be purchased; it was
								conferred for the first time in 1270; and equality was thus introduced into the
								Government by the aristocracy itself.
							</p>

							<p>
								In the course of these seven hundred years it sometimes happened that in order
								to resist the authority of the Crown, or to diminish the power of their rivals,
								the nobles granted a certain share of political rights to the people. Or, more
								frequently, the king permitted the lower orders to enjoy a degree of power,
								with the intention of repressing the aristocracy. In France the kings have
								always been the most active and the most constant of levellers. When they were
								strong and ambitious they spared no pains to raise the people to the level of
								the nobles; when they were temperate or weak they allowed the people to rise
								above themselves. Some assisted the democracy by their talents, others by their
								vices. Louis XI and Louis XIV reduced every rank beneath the throne to the same
								subjection; Louis XV descended, himself and all his Court, into the dust.
							</p>

							<p>
								As soon as land was held on any other than a feudal tenure, and personal
								property began in its turn to confer influence and power, every improvement
								which was introduced in commerce or manufacture was a fresh element of the
								equality of conditions. Henceforward every new discovery, every new want which
								it engendered, and every new desire which craved satisfaction, was a step
								towards the universal level. The taste for luxury, the love of war, the sway of
								fashion, and the most superficial as well as the deepest passions of the human
								heart, co-operated to enrich the poor and to impoverish the rich.
							</p>

							<p>
								From the time when the exercise of the intellect became the source of strength
								and of wealth, it is impossible not to consider every addition to science,
								every fresh truth, and every new idea as a germ of power placed within the
								reach of the people. Poetry, eloquence, and memory, the grace of wit, the glow
								of imagination, the depth of thought, and all the gifts which are bestowed by
								Providence with an equal hand, turned to the advantage of the democracy; and
								even when they were in the possession of its adversaries they still served its
								cause by throwing into relief the natural greatness of man; its conquests
								spread, therefore, with those of civilization and knowledge, and literature
								became an arsenal where the poorest and the weakest could always find weapons
								to their hand.
							</p>

							<p>
								In perusing the pages of our history, we shall scarcely meet with a single
								great event, in the lapse of seven hundred years, which has not turned to the
								advantage of equality. The Crusades and the wars of the English decimated the
								nobles and divided their possessions; the erection of communities introduced an
								element of democratic liberty into the bosom of feudal monarchy; the invention
								of fire-arms equalized the villein and the noble on the field of battle;
								printing opened the same resources to the minds of all classes; the post was
								organized so as to bring the same information to the door of the poor
								man&rsquo;s cottage and to the gate of the palace; and Protestantism proclaimed
								that all men are alike able to find the road to heaven. The discovery of
								America offered a thousand new paths to fortune, and placed riches and power
								within the reach of the adventurous and the obscure. If we examine what has
								happened in France at intervals of fifty years, beginning with the eleventh
								century, we shall invariably perceive that a twofold revolution has taken place
								in the state of society. The noble has gone down on the social ladder, and the
								roturier has gone up; the one descends as the other rises. Every half century
								brings them nearer to each other, and they will very shortly meet.
							</p>

							<p>
								Nor is this phenomenon at all peculiar to France. Whithersoever we turn our
								eyes we shall witness the same continual revolution throughout the whole of
								Christendom. The various occurrences of national existence have everywhere
								turned to the advantage of democracy; all men have aided it by their exertions:
								those who have intentionally labored in its cause, and those who have served it
								unwittingly; those who have fought for it and those who have declared
								themselves its opponents, have all been driven along in the same track, have
								all labored to one end, some ignorantly and some unwillingly; all have been
								blind instruments in the hands of God.
							</p>

							<p>
								The gradual development of the equality of conditions is therefore a
								providential fact, and it possesses all the characteristics of a divine decree:
								it is universal, it is durable, it constantly eludes all human interference,
								and all events as well as all men contribute to its progress. Would it, then,
								be wise to imagine that a social impulse which dates from so far back can be
								checked by the efforts of a generation? Is it credible that the democracy which
								has annihilated the feudal system and vanquished kings will respect the citizen
								and the capitalist? Will it stop now that it has grown so strong and its
								adversaries so weak? None can say which way we are going, for all terms of
								comparison are wanting: the equality of conditions is more complete in the
								Christian countries of the present day than it has been at any time or in any
								part of the world; so that the extent of what already exists prevents us from
								foreseeing what may be yet to come.
							</p>

							<p>
								The whole book which is here offered to the public has been written under the
								impression of a kind of religious dread produced in the author&rsquo;s mind by
								the contemplation of so irresistible a revolution, which has advanced for
								centuries in spite of such amazing obstacles, and which is still proceeding in
								the midst of the ruins it has made. It is not necessary that God himself should
								speak in order to disclose to us the unquestionable signs of His will; we can
								discern them in the habitual course of nature, and in the invariable tendency
								of events: I know, without a special revelation, that the planets move in the
								orbits traced by the Creator&rsquo;s finger. If the men of our time were led by
								attentive observation and by sincere reflection to acknowledge that the gradual
								and progressive development of social equality is at once the past and future
								of their history, this solitary truth would confer the sacred character of a
								Divine decree upon the change. To attempt to check democracy would be in that
								case to resist the will of God; and the nations would then be constrained to
								make the best of the social lot awarded to them by Providence.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Christian nations of our age seem to me to present a most alarming
								spectacle; the impulse which is bearing them along is so strong that it cannot
								be stopped, but it is not yet so rapid that it cannot be guided: their fate is
								in their hands; yet a little while and it may be so no longer. The first duty
								which is at this time imposed upon those who direct our affairs is to educate
								the democracy; to warm its faith, if that be possible; to purify its morals; to
								direct its energies; to substitute a knowledge of business for its
								inexperience, and an acquaintance with its true interests for its blind
								propensities; to adapt its government to time and place, and to modify it in
								compliance with the occurrences and the actors of the age. A new science of
								politics is indispensable to a new world. This, however, is what we think of
								least; launched in the middle of a rapid stream, we obstinately fix our eyes on
								the ruins which may still be described upon the shore we have left, whilst the
								current sweeps us along, and drives us backwards towards the gulf.
							</p>

							<p>
								In no country in Europe has the great social revolution which I have been
								describing made such rapid progress as in France; but it has always been borne
								on by chance. The heads of the State have never had any forethought for its
								exigencies, and its victories have been obtained without their consent or
								without their knowledge. The most powerful, the most intelligent, and the most
								moral classes of the nation have never attempted to connect themselves with it
								in order to guide it. The people has consequently been abandoned to its wild
								propensities, and it has grown up like those outcasts who receive their
								education in the public streets, and who are unacquainted with aught but the
								vices and wretchedness of society. The existence of a democracy was seemingly
								unknown, when on a sudden it took possession of the supreme power. Everything
								was then submitted to its caprices; it was worshipped as the idol of strength;
								until, when it was enfeebled by its own excesses, the legislator conceived the
								rash project of annihilating its power, instead of instructing it and
								correcting its vices; no attempt was made to fit it to govern, but all were
								bent on excluding it from the government.
							</p>

							<p>
								The consequence of this has been that the democratic revolution has been
								effected only in the material parts of society, without that concomitant change
								in laws, ideas, customs, and manners which was necessary to render such a
								revolution beneficial. We have gotten a democracy, but without the conditions
								which lessen its vices and render its natural advantages more prominent; and
								although we already perceive the evils it brings, we are ignorant of the
								benefits it may confer.
							</p>

							<p>
								While the power of the Crown, supported by the aristocracy, peaceably governed
								the nations of Europe, society possessed, in the midst of its wretchedness,
								several different advantages which can now scarcely be appreciated or
								conceived. The power of a part of his subjects was an insurmountable barrier to
								the tyranny of the prince; and the monarch, who felt the almost divine
								character which he enjoyed in the eyes of the multitude, derived a motive for
								the just use of his power from the respect which he inspired. High as they were
								placed above the people, the nobles could not but take that calm and benevolent
								interest in its fate which the shepherd feels towards his flock; and without
								acknowledging the poor as their equals, they watched over the destiny of those
								whose welfare Providence had entrusted to their care. The people never having
								conceived the idea of a social condition different from its own, and
								entertaining no expectation of ever ranking with its chiefs, received benefits
								from them without discussing their rights. It grew attached to them when they
								were clement and just, and it submitted without resistance or servility to
								their exactions, as to the inevitable visitations of the arm of God. Custom,
								and the manners of the time, had moreover created a species of law in the midst
								of violence, and established certain limits to oppression. As the noble never
								suspected that anyone would attempt to deprive him of the privileges which he
								believed to be legitimate, and as the serf looked upon his own inferiority as a
								consequence of the immutable order of nature, it is easy to imagine that a
								mutual exchange of good-will took place between two classes so differently
								gifted by fate. Inequality and wretchedness were then to be found in society;
								but the souls of neither rank of men were degraded. Men are not corrupted by
								the exercise of power or debased by the habit of obedience, but by the exercise
								of a power which they believe to be illegal and by obedience to a rule which
								they consider to be usurped and oppressive. On one side was wealth, strength,
								and leisure, accompanied by the refinements of luxury, the elegance of taste,
								the pleasures of wit, and the religion of art. On the other was labor and a
								rude ignorance; but in the midst of this coarse and ignorant multitude it was
								not uncommon to meet with energetic passions, generous sentiments, profound
								religious convictions, and independent virtues. The body of a State thus
								organized might boast of its stability, its power, and, above all, of its
								glory.
							</p>

							<p>
								But the scene is now changed, and gradually the two ranks mingle; the divisions
								which once severed mankind are lowered, property is divided, power is held in
								common, the light of intelligence spreads, and the capacities of all classes
								are equally cultivated; the State becomes democratic, and the empire of
								democracy is slowly and peaceably introduced into the institutions and the
								manners of the nation. I can conceive a society in which all men would profess
								an equal attachment and respect for the laws of which they are the common
								authors; in which the authority of the State would be respected as necessary,
								though not as divine; and the loyalty of the subject to its chief magistrate
								would not be a passion, but a quiet and rational persuasion. Every individual
								being in the possession of rights which he is sure to retain, a kind of manly
								reliance and reciprocal courtesy would arise between all classes, alike removed
								from pride and meanness. The people, well acquainted with its true interests,
								would allow that in order to profit by the advantages of society it is
								necessary to satisfy its demands. In this state of things the voluntary
								association of the citizens might supply the individual exertions of the
								nobles, and the community would be alike protected from anarchy and from
								oppression.
							</p>

							<p>
								I admit that, in a democratic State thus constituted, society will not be
								stationary; but the impulses of the social body may be regulated and directed
								forwards; if there be less splendor than in the halls of an aristocracy, the
								contrast of misery will be less frequent also; the pleasures of enjoyment may
								be less excessive, but those of comfort will be more general; the sciences may
								be less perfectly cultivated, but ignorance will be less common; the
								impetuosity of the feelings will be repressed, and the habits of the nation
								softened; there will be more vices and fewer crimes. In the absence of
								enthusiasm and of an ardent faith, great sacrifices may be obtained from the
								members of a commonwealth by an appeal to their understandings and their
								experience; each individual will feel the same necessity for uniting with his
								fellow-citizens to protect his own weakness; and as he knows that if they are
								to assist he must co-operate, he will readily perceive that his personal
								interest is identified with the interest of the community. The nation, taken as
								a whole, will be less brilliant, less glorious, and perhaps less strong; but
								the majority of the citizens will enjoy a greater degree of prosperity, and the
								people will remain quiet, not because it despairs of amelioration, but because
								it is conscious of the advantages of its condition. If all the consequences of
								this state of things were not good or useful, society would at least have
								appropriated all such as were useful and good; and having once and for ever
								renounced the social advantages of aristocracy, mankind would enter into
								possession of all the benefits which democracy can afford.
							</p>

							<p>
								But here it may be asked what we have adopted in the place of those
								institutions, those ideas, and those customs of our forefathers which we have
								abandoned. The spell of royalty is broken, but it has not been succeeded by the
								majesty of the laws; the people has learned to despise all authority, but fear
								now extorts a larger tribute of obedience than that which was formerly paid by
								reverence and by love.
							</p>

							<p>
								I perceive that we have destroyed those independent beings which were able to
								cope with tyranny single-handed; but it is the Government that has inherited
								the privileges of which families, corporations, and individuals have been
								deprived; the weakness of the whole community has therefore succeeded that
								influence of a small body of citizens, which, if it was sometimes oppressive,
								was often conservative. The division of property has lessened the distance
								which separated the rich from the poor; but it would seem that the nearer they
								draw to each other, the greater is their mutual hatred, and the more vehement
								the envy and the dread with which they resist each other&rsquo;s claims to
								power; the notion of Right is alike insensible to both classes, and Force
								affords to both the only argument for the present, and the only guarantee for
								the future. The poor man retains the prejudices of his forefathers without
								their faith, and their ignorance without their virtues; he has adopted the
								doctrine of self-interest as the rule of his actions, without understanding the
								science which controls it, and his egotism is no less blind than his
								devotedness was formerly. If society is tranquil, it is not because it relies
								upon its strength and its well-being, but because it knows its weakness and its
								infirmities; a single effort may cost it its life; everybody feels the evil,
								but no one has courage or energy enough to seek the cure; the desires, the
								regret, the sorrows, and the joys of the time produce nothing that is visible
								or permanent, like the passions of old men which terminate in impotence.
							</p>

							<p>
								We have, then, abandoned whatever advantages the old state of things afforded,
								without receiving any compensation from our present condition; we have
								destroyed an aristocracy, and we seem inclined to survey its ruins with
								complacency, and to fix our abode in the midst of them.
							</p>

							<p>
								The phenomena which the intellectual world presents are not less deplorable.
								The democracy of France, checked in its course or abandoned to its lawless
								passions, has overthrown whatever crossed its path, and has shaken all that it
								has not destroyed. Its empire on society has not been gradually introduced or
								peaceably established, but it has constantly advanced in the midst of disorder
								and the agitation of a conflict. In the heat of the struggle each partisan is
								hurried beyond the limits of his opinions by the opinions and the excesses of
								his opponents, until he loses sight of the end of his exertions, and holds a
								language which disguises his real sentiments or secret instincts. Hence arises
								the strange confusion which we are witnessing. I cannot recall to my mind a
								passage in history more worthy of sorrow and of pity than the scenes which are
								happening under our eyes; it is as if the natural bond which unites the
								opinions of man to his tastes and his actions to his principles was now broken;
								the sympathy which has always been acknowledged between the feelings and the
								ideas of mankind appears to be dissolved, and all the laws of moral analogy to
								be abolished.
							</p>

							<p>
								Zealous Christians may be found amongst us whose minds are nurtured in the love
								and knowledge of a future life, and who readily espouse the cause of human
								liberty as the source of all moral greatness. Christianity, which has declared
								that all men are equal in the sight of God, will not refuse to acknowledge that
								all citizens are equal in the eye of the law. But, by a singular concourse of
								events, religion is entangled in those institutions which democracy assails,
								and it is not unfrequently brought to reject the equality it loves, and to
								curse that cause of liberty as a foe which it might hallow by its alliance.
							</p>

							<p>
								By the side of these religious men I discern others whose looks are turned to
								the earth more than to Heaven; they are the partisans of liberty, not only as
								the source of the noblest virtues, but more especially as the root of all solid
								advantages; and they sincerely desire to extend its sway, and to impart its
								blessings to mankind. It is natural that they should hasten to invoke the
								assistance of religion, for they must know that liberty cannot be established
								without morality, nor morality without faith; but they have seen religion in
								the ranks of their adversaries, and they inquire no further; some of them
								attack it openly, and the remainder are afraid to defend it.
							</p>

							<p>
								In former ages slavery has been advocated by the venal and slavish-minded,
								whilst the independent and the warm-hearted were struggling without hope to
								save the liberties of mankind. But men of high and generous characters are now
								to be met with, whose opinions are at variance with their inclinations, and who
								praise that servility which they have themselves never known. Others, on the
								contrary, speak in the name of liberty, as if they were able to feel its
								sanctity and its majesty, and loudly claim for humanity those rights which they
								have always disowned. There are virtuous and peaceful individuals whose pure
								morality, quiet habits, affluence, and talents fit them to be the leaders of
								the surrounding population; their love of their country is sincere, and they
								are prepared to make the greatest sacrifices to its welfare, but they confound
								the abuses of civilization with its benefits, and the idea of evil is
								inseparable in their minds from that of novelty.
							</p>

							<p>
								Not far from this class is another party, whose object is to materialize
								mankind, to hit upon what is expedient without heeding what is just, to acquire
								knowledge without faith, and prosperity apart from virtue; assuming the title
								of the champions of modern civilization, and placing themselves in a station
								which they usurp with insolence, and from which they are driven by their own
								unworthiness. Where are we then? The religionists are the enemies of liberty,
								and the friends of liberty attack religion; the high-minded and the noble
								advocate subjection, and the meanest and most servile minds preach
								independence; honest and enlightened citizens are opposed to all progress,
								whilst men without patriotism and without principles are the apostles of
								civilization and of intelligence. Has such been the fate of the centuries which
								have preceded our own? and has man always inhabited a world like the present,
								where nothing is linked together, where virtue is without genius, and genius
								without honor; where the love of order is confounded with a taste for
								oppression, and the holy rites of freedom with a contempt of law; where the
								light thrown by conscience on human actions is dim, and where nothing seems to
								be any longer forbidden or allowed, honorable or shameful, false or true? I
								cannot, however, believe that the Creator made man to leave him in an endless
								struggle with the intellectual miseries which surround us: God destines a
								calmer and a more certain future to the communities of Europe; I am
								unacquainted with His designs, but I shall not cease to believe in them because
								I cannot fathom them, and I had rather mistrust my own capacity than His
								justice.
							</p>

							<p>
								There is a country in the world where the great revolution which I am speaking
								of seems nearly to have reached its natural limits; it has been effected with
								ease and simplicity, say rather that this country has attained the consequences
								of the democratic revolution which we are undergoing without having experienced
								the revolution itself. The emigrants who fixed themselves on the shores of
								America in the beginning of the seventeenth century severed the democratic
								principle from all the principles which repressed it in the old communities of
								Europe, and transplanted it unalloyed to the New World. It has there been
								allowed to spread in perfect freedom, and to put forth its consequences in the
								laws by influencing the manners of the country.
							</p>

							<p>
								It appears to me beyond a doubt that sooner or later we shall arrive, like the
								Americans, at an almost complete equality of conditions. But I do not conclude
								from this that we shall ever be necessarily led to draw the same political
								consequences which the Americans have derived from a similar social
								organization. I am far from supposing that they have chosen the only form of
								government which a democracy may adopt; but the identity of the efficient cause
								of laws and manners in the two countries is sufficient to account for the
								immense interest we have in becoming acquainted with its effects in each of
								them.
							</p>

							<p>
								It is not, then, merely to satisfy a legitimate curiosity that I have examined
								America; my wish has been to find instruction by which we may ourselves profit.
								Whoever should imagine that I have intended to write a panegyric will perceive
								that such was not my design; nor has it been my object to advocate any form of
								government in particular, for I am of opinion that absolute excellence is
								rarely to be found in any legislation; I have not even affected to discuss
								whether the social revolution, which I believe to be irresistible, is
								advantageous or prejudicial to mankind; I have acknowledged this revolution as
								a fact already accomplished or on the eve of its accomplishment; and I have
								selected the nation, from amongst those which have undergone it, in which its
								development has been the most peaceful and the most complete, in order to
								discern its natural consequences, and, if it be possible, to distinguish the
								means by which it may be rendered profitable. I confess that in America I saw
								more than America; I sought the image of democracy itself, with its
								inclinations, its character, its prejudices, and its passions, in order to
								learn what we have to fear or to hope from its progress.
							</p>

							<p>
								In the first part of this work I have attempted to show the tendency given to
								the laws by the democracy of America, which is abandoned almost without
								restraint to its instinctive propensities, and to exhibit the course it
								prescribes to the Government and the influence it exercises on affairs. I have
								sought to discover the evils and the advantages which it produces. I have
								examined the precautions used by the Americans to direct it, as well as those
								which they have not adopted, and I have undertaken to point out the causes
								which enable it to govern society. I do not know whether I have succeeded in
								making known what I saw in America, but I am certain that such has been my
								sincere desire, and that I have never, knowingly, moulded facts to ideas,
								instead of ideas to facts.
							</p>

							<p>
								Whenever a point could be established by the aid of written documents, I have
								had recourse to the original text, and to the most authentic and approved
								works. I have cited my authorities in the notes, and anyone may refer to them.
								Whenever an opinion, a political custom, or a remark on the manners of the
								country was concerned, I endeavored to consult the most enlightened men I met
								with. If the point in question was important or doubtful, I was not satisfied
								with one testimony, but I formed my opinion on the evidence of several
								witnesses. Here the reader must necessarily believe me upon my word. I could
								frequently have quoted names which are either known to him, or which deserve to
								be so, in proof of what I advance; but I have carefully abstained from this
								practice. A stranger frequently hears important truths at the fire-side of his
								host, which the latter would perhaps conceal from the ear of friendship; he
								consoles himself with his guest for the silence to which he is restricted, and
								the shortness of the traveller&rsquo;s stay takes away all fear of his
								indiscretion. I carefully noted every conversation of this nature as soon as it
								occurred, but these notes will never leave my writing-case; I had rather injure
								the success of my statements than add my name to the list of those strangers
								who repay the generous hospitality they have received by subsequent chagrin and
								annoyance.
							</p>

							<p>
								I am aware that, notwithstanding my care, nothing will be easier than to
								criticise this book, if anyone ever chooses to criticise it. Those readers who
								may examine it closely will discover the fundamental idea which connects the
								several parts together. But the diversity of the subjects I have had to treat
								is exceedingly great, and it will not be difficult to oppose an isolated fact
								to the body of facts which I quote, or an isolated idea to the body of ideas I
								put forth. I hope to be read in the spirit which has guided my labors, and that
								my book may be judged by the general impression it leaves, as I have formed my
								own judgment not on any single reason, but upon the mass of evidence. It must
								not be forgotten that the author who wishes to be understood is obliged to push
								all his ideas to their utmost theoretical consequences, and often to the verge
								of what is false or impracticable; for if it be necessary sometimes to quit the
								rules of logic in active life, such is not the case in discourse, and a man
								finds that almost as many difficulties spring from inconsistency of language as
								usually arise from inconsistency of conduct.
							</p>

							<p>
								I conclude by pointing out myself what many readers will consider the principal
								defect of the work. This book is written to favor no particular views, and in
								composing it I have entertained no designs of serving or attacking any party; I
								have undertaken not to see differently, but to look further than parties, and
								whilst they are busied for the morrow I have turned my thoughts to the Future.

							</p>

							<p>
								Exterior Form Of North America
							</p>

							<p>
								North America presents in its external form certain general features which it
								is easy to discriminate at the first glance. A sort of methodical order seems
								to have regulated the separation of land and water, mountains and valleys. A
								simple, but grand, arrangement is discoverable amidst the confusion of objects
								and the prodigious variety of scenes. This continent is divided, almost
								equally, into two vast regions, one of which is bounded on the north by the
								Arctic Pole, and by the two great oceans on the east and west. It stretches
								towards the south, forming a triangle whose irregular sides meet at length
								below the great lakes of Canada. The second region begins where the other
								terminates, and includes all the remainder of the continent. The one slopes
								gently towards the Pole, the other towards the Equator.
							</p>

							<p>
								The territory comprehended in the first region descends towards the north with
								so imperceptible a slope that it may almost be said to form a level plain.
								Within the bounds of this immense tract of country there are neither high
								mountains nor deep valleys. Streams meander through it irregularly: great
								rivers mix their currents, separate and meet again, disperse and form vast
								marshes, losing all trace of their channels in the labyrinth of waters they
								have themselves created; and thus, at length, after innumerable windings, fall
								into the Polar Seas. The great lakes which bound this first region are not
								walled in, like most of those in the Old World, between hills and rocks. Their
								banks are flat, and rise but a few feet above the level of their waters; each
								of them thus forming a vast bowl filled to the brim. The slightest change in
								the structure of the globe would cause their waters to rush either towards the
								Pole or to the tropical sea.
							</p>

							<p>
								The second region is more varied on its surface, and better suited for the
								habitation of man. Two long chains of mountains divide it from one extreme to
								the other; the Alleghany ridge takes the form of the shores of the Atlantic
								Ocean; the other is parallel with the Pacific. The space which lies between
								these two chains of mountains contains 1,341,649 square miles. *a Its surface
								is therefore about six times as great as that of France. This vast territory,
								however, forms a single valley, one side of which descends gradually from the
								rounded summits of the Alleghanies, while the other rises in an uninterrupted
								course towards the tops of the Rocky Mountains. At the bottom of the valley
								flows an immense river, into which the various streams issuing from the
								mountains fall from all parts. In memory of their native land, the French
								formerly called this river the St. Louis. The Indians, in their pompous
								language, have named it the Father of Waters, or the Mississippi.
							</p>

</p>

								<p>
									The Mississippi takes its source above the limit of the two great regions of
									which I have spoken, not far from the highest point of the table-land where
									they unite. Near the same spot rises another river, *b which empties itself
									into the Polar seas. The course of the Mississippi is at first dubious: it
									winds several times towards the north, from whence it rose; and at length,
									after having been delayed in lakes and marshes, it flows slowly onwards to the
									south. Sometimes quietly gliding along the argillaceous bed which nature has
									assigned to it, sometimes swollen by storms, the Mississippi waters 2,500 miles
									in its course. *c At the distance of 1,364 miles from its mouth this river
									attains an average depth of fifteen feet; and it is navigated by vessels of 300
									tons burden for a course of nearly 500 miles. Fifty-seven large navigable
									rivers contribute to swell the waters of the Mississippi; amongst others, the
									Missouri, which traverses a space of 2,500 miles; the Arkansas of 1,300 miles,
									the Red River 1,000 miles, four whose course is from 800 to 1,000 miles in
									length, viz., the Illinois, the St. Peter&rsquo;s, the St. Francis, and the
									Moingona; besides a countless multitude of rivulets which unite from all parts
									their tributary streams.

											The valley which is watered by the Mississippi seems formed to be the bed of
											this mighty river, which, like a god of antiquity, dispenses both good and
											evil
											in its course. On the shores of the stream nature displays an inexhaustible
											fertility; in proportion as you recede from its banks, the powers of
											vegetation
											languish, the soil becomes poor, and the plants that survive have a sickly
											growth. Nowhere have the great convulsions of the globe left more evident
											traces than in the valley of the Mississippi; the whole aspect of the
											country
											shows the powerful effects of water, both by its fertility and by its
											barrenness. The waters of the primeval ocean accumulated enormous beds of
											vegetable mould in the valley, which they levelled as they retired. Upon the
											right shore of the river are seen immense plains, as smooth as if the
											husbandman had passed over them with his roller. As you approach the
											mountains
											the soil becomes more and more unequal and sterile; the ground is, as it
											were,
											pierced in a thousand places by primitive rocks, which appear like the bones
											of
											a skeleton whose flesh is partly consumed. The surface of the earth is
											covered
											with a granite sand and huge irregular masses of stone, among which a few
											plants force their growth, and give the appearance of a green field covered
											with the ruins of a vast edifice. These stones and this sand discover, on
											examination, a perfect analogy with those which compose the arid and broken
											summits of the Rocky Mountains. The flood of waters which washed the soil to
											the bottom of the valley afterwards carried away portions of the rocks
											themselves; and these, dashed and bruised against the neighboring cliffs,
											were
											left scattered like wrecks at their feet. *d The valley of the Mississippi
											is,
											upon the whole, the most magnificent dwelling-place prepared by God for
											man&rsquo;s abode; and yet it may be said that at present it is but a mighty
											desert.

												On the eastern side of the Alleghanies, between the base of these
												mountains and
												the Atlantic Ocean, there lies a long ridge of rocks and sand, which the
												sea
												appears to have left behind as it retired. The mean breadth of this
												territory
												does not exceed one hundred miles; but it is about nine hundred miles in
												length. This part of the American continent has a soil which offers
												every
												obstacle to the husbandman, and its vegetation is scanty and unvaried.
											</p>

											<p>
												Upon this inhospitable coast the first united efforts of human industry
												were
												made. The tongue of arid land was the cradle of those English colonies
												which
												were destined one day to become the United States of America. The centre
												of
												power still remains here; whilst in the backwoods the true elements of
												the
												great people to whom the future control of the continent belongs are
												gathering
												almost in secrecy together.
											</p>

											<p>
												When the Europeans first landed on the shores of the West Indies, and
												afterwards on the coast of South America, they thought themselves
												transported
												into those fabulous regions of which poets had sung. The sea sparkled
												with
												phosphoric light, and the extraordinary transparency of its waters
												discovered
												to the view of the navigator all that had hitherto been hidden in the
												deep
												abyss. *e Here and there appeared little islands perfumed with
												odoriferous
												plants, and resembling baskets of flowers floating on the tranquil
												surface of
												the ocean. Every object which met the sight, in this enchanting region,
												seemed
												prepared to satisfy the wants or contribute to the pleasures of man.
												Almost all
												the trees were loaded with nourishing fruits, and those which were
												useless as
												food delighted the eye by the brilliancy and variety of their colors. In
												groves
												of fragrant lemon-trees, wild figs, flowering myrtles, acacias, and
												oleanders,
												which were hung with festoons of various climbing plants, covered with
												flowers,
												a multitude of birds unknown in Europe displayed their bright plumage,
												glittering with purple and azure, and mingled their warbling with the
												harmony
												of a world teeming with life and motion. *f Underneath this brilliant
												exterior
												death was concealed. But the air of these climates had so enervating an
												influence that man, absorbed by present enjoyment, was rendered
												regardless of
												the future.

so transparent that corals and fish are discernible at a depth of sixty
fathoms. The ship seemed to float in air, the navigator became giddy as his eye
penetrated through the crystal flood, and beheld submarine gardens, or beds of
shells, or gilded fishes gliding among tufts and thickets of seaweed.]

														North America appeared under a very different aspect; there
														everything was
														grave, serious, and solemn: it seemed created to be the domain
														of intelligence,
														as the South was that of sensual delight. A turbulent and foggy
														ocean washed
														its shores. It was girt round by a belt of granite rocks, or by
														wide tracts of
														sand. The foliage of its woods was dark and gloomy, for they
														were composed of
														firs, larches, evergreen oaks, wild olive-trees, and laurels.
														Beyond this outer
														belt lay the thick shades of the central forest, where the
														largest trees which
														are produced in the two hemispheres grow side by side. The
														plane, the catalpa,
														the sugar-maple, and the Virginian poplar mingled their branches
														with those of
														the oak, the beech, and the lime. In these, as in the forests of
														the Old World,
														destruction was perpetually going on. The ruins of vegetation
														were heaped upon
														each other; but there was no laboring hand to remove them, and
														their decay was
														not rapid enough to make room for the continual work of
														reproduction. Climbing
														plants, grasses, and other herbs forced their way through the
														mass of dying
														trees; they crept along their bending trunks, found nourishment
														in their dusty
														cavities, and a passage beneath the lifeless bark. Thus decay
														gave its
														assistance to life, and their respective productions were
														mingled together. The
														depths of these forests were gloomy and obscure, and a thousand
														rivulets,
														undirected in their course by human industry, preserved in them
														a constant
														moisture. It was rare to meet with flowers, wild fruits, or
														birds beneath their
														shades. The fall of a tree overthrown by age, the rushing
														torrent of a
														cataract, the lowing of the buffalo, and the howling of the wind
														were the only
														sounds which broke the silence of nature.
													</p>

													<p>
														To the east of the great river, the woods almost disappeared; in
														their stead
														were seen prairies of immense extent. Whether Nature in her
														infinite variety
														had denied the germs of trees to these fertile plains, or
														whether they had once
														been covered with forests, subsequently destroyed by the hand of
														man, is a
														question which neither tradition nor scientific research has
														been able to
														resolve.
													</p>

													<p>
														These immense deserts were not, however, devoid of human
														inhabitants. Some
														wandering tribes had been for ages scattered among the forest
														shades or the
														green pastures of the prairie. From the mouth of the St.
														Lawrence to the delta
														of the Mississippi, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean,
														these savages
														possessed certain points of resemblance which bore witness of
														their common
														origin; but at the same time they differed from all other known
														races of men:
														*g they were neither white like the Europeans, nor yellow like
														most of the
														Asiatics, nor black like the negroes. Their skin was reddish
														brown, their hair
														long and shining, their lips thin, and their cheekbones very
														prominent. The
														languages spoken by the North American tribes are various as far
														as regarded
														their words, but they were subject to the same grammatical
														rules. These rules
														differed in several points from such as had been observed to
														govern the origin
														of language. The idiom of the Americans seemed to be the product
														of new
														combinations, and bespoke an effort of the understanding of
														which the Indians
														of our days would be incapable. *h

[ With the progress of discovery some resemblance has been found to exist
between the physical conformation, the language, and the habits of the Indians
of North America, and those of the Tongous, Mantchous, Mongols, Tartars, and
other wandering tribes of Asia. The land occupied by these tribes is not very
distant from Behring&rsquo;s Strait, which allows of the supposition, that at a
remote period they gave inhabitants to the desert continent of America. But
this is a point which has not yet been clearly elucidated by science. See Malte
Brun, vol. v.; the works of Humboldt; Fischer, &ldquo;Conjecture sur
l&rsquo;Origine des Americains&rdquo;; Adair, &ldquo;History of the American
Indians.&rdquo;]

																The social state of these tribes differed also in many
																respects from all that
																was seen in the Old World. They seemed to have
																multiplied freely in the midst
																of their deserts without coming in contact with other
																races more civilized than
																their own. Accordingly, they exhibited none of those
																indistinct, incoherent
																notions of right and wrong, none of that deep corruption
																of manners, which is
																usually joined with ignorance and rudeness among nations
																which, after advancing
																to civilization, have relapsed into a state of
																barbarism. The Indian was
																indebted to no one but himself; his virtues, his vices,
																and his prejudices were
																his own work; he had grown up in the wild independence
																of his nature.
															</p>

															<p>
																If, in polished countries, the lowest of the people are
																rude and uncivil, it is
																not merely because they are poor and ignorant, but that,
																being so, they are in
																daily contact with rich and enlightened men. The sight
																of their own hard lot
																and of their weakness, which is daily contrasted with
																the happiness and power
																of some of their fellow-creatures, excites in their
																hearts at the same time the
																sentiments of anger and of fear: the consciousness of
																their inferiority and of
																their dependence irritates while it humiliates them.
																This state of mind
																displays itself in their manners and language; they are
																at once insolent and
																servile. The truth of this is easily proved by
																observation; the people are more
																rude in aristocratic countries than elsewhere, in
																opulent cities than in rural
																districts. In those places where the rich and powerful
																are assembled together
																the weak and the indigent feel themselves oppressed by
																their inferior
																condition. Unable to perceive a single chance of
																regaining their equality, they
																give up to despair, and allow themselves to fall below
																the dignity of human
																nature.
															</p>

															<p>
																This unfortunate effect of the disparity of conditions
																is not observable in
																savage life: the Indians, although they are ignorant and
																poor, are equal and
																free. At the period when Europeans first came among them
																the natives of North
																America were ignorant of the value of riches, and
																indifferent to the enjoyments
																which civilized man procures to himself by their means.
																Nevertheless there was
																nothing coarse in their demeanor; they practised an
																habitual reserve and a kind
																of aristocratic politeness. Mild and hospitable when at
																peace, though merciless
																in war beyond any known degree of human ferocity, the
																Indian would expose
																himself to die of hunger in order to succor the stranger
																who asked admittance
																by night at the door of his hut; yet he could tear in
																pieces with his hands the
																still quivering limbs of his prisoner. The famous
																republics of antiquity never
																gave examples of more unshaken courage, more haughty
																spirits, or more
																intractable love of independence than were hidden in
																former times among the
																wild forests of the New World. *i The Europeans produced
																no great impression
																when they landed upon the shores of North America; their
																presence engendered
																neither envy nor fear. What influence could they possess
																over such men as we
																have described? The Indian could live without wants,
																suffer without complaint,
																and pour out his death-song at the stake. *j Like all
																the other members of the
																great human family, these savages believed in the
																existence of a better world,
																and adored under different names, God, the creator of
																the universe. Their
																notions on the great intellectual truths were in general
																simple and
																philosophical. *k

																			Although we have here traced the character
																			of a primitive people, yet it cannot
																			be doubted that another people, more
																			civilized and more advanced in all
																			respects, had preceded it in the same
																			regions.
																		</p>

																		<p>
																			An obscure tradition which prevailed among
																			the Indians to the north of the
																			Atlantic informs us that these very tribes
																			formerly dwelt on the west side of
																			the Mississippi. Along the banks of the
																			Ohio, and throughout the central
																			valley, there are frequently found, at this
																			day, tumuli raised by the hands of
																			men. On exploring these heaps of earth to
																			their centre, it is usual to meet
																			with human bones, strange instruments, arms
																			and utensils of all kinds, made of
																			metal, or destined for purposes unknown to
																			the present race. The Indians of our
																			time are unable to give any information
																			relative to the history of this unknown
																			people. Neither did those who lived three
																			hundred years ago, when America was
																			first discovered, leave any accounts from
																			which even an hypothesis could be
																			formed. Tradition&mdash;that perishable, yet
																			ever renewed monument of the
																			pristine world&mdash;throws no light upon
																			the subject. It is an undoubted fact,
																			however, that in this part of the globe
																			thousands of our fellow-beings had
																			lived. When they came hither, what was their
																			origin, their destiny, their
																			history, and how they perished, no one can
																			tell. How strange does it appear
																			that nations have existed, and afterwards so
																			completely disappeared from the
																			earth that the remembrance of their very
																			names is effaced; their languages are
																			lost; their glory is vanished like a sound
																			without an echo; though perhaps
																			there is not one which has not left behind
																			it some tomb in memory of its
																			passage! The most durable monument of human
																			labor is that which recalls the
																			wretchedness and nothingness of man.
																		</p>

																		<p>
																			Although the vast country which we have been
																			describing was inhabited by many
																			indigenous tribes, it may justly be said at
																			the time of its discovery by
																			Europeans to have formed one great desert.
																			The Indians occupied without
																			possessing it. It is by agricultural labor
																			that man appropriates the soil, and
																			the early inhabitants of North America lived
																			by the produce of the chase. Their
																			implacable prejudices, their uncontrolled
																			passions, their vices, and still more
																			perhaps their savage virtues, consigned them
																			to inevitable destruction. The
																			ruin of these nations began from the day
																			when Europeans landed on their shores;
																			it has proceeded ever since, and we are now
																			witnessing the completion of it.
																			They seem to have been placed by Providence
																			amidst the riches of the New World
																			to enjoy them for a season, and then
																			surrender them. Those coasts, so admirably
																			adapted for commerce and industry; those
																			wide and deep rivers; that
																			inexhaustible valley of the Mississippi; the
																			whole continent, in short, seemed
																			prepared to be the abode of a great nation,
																			yet unborn.
																		</p>

																		<p>
																			In that land the great experiment was to be
																			made, by civilized man, of the
																			attempt to construct society upon a new
																			basis; and it was there, for the first
																			time, that theories hitherto unknown, or
																			deemed impracticable, were to exhibit
																			a spectacle for which the world had not been
																			prepared by the history of the
																			past.

								Origin Of The Anglo-Americans, And Its Importance In Relation To Their Future
								Condition.
							</p>

							<p>
								After the birth of a human being his early years are obscurely spent in the
								toils or pleasures of childhood. As he grows up the world receives him, when
								his manhood begins, and he enters into contact with his fellows. He is then
								studied for the first time, and it is imagined that the germ of the vices and
								the virtues of his maturer years is then formed. This, if I am not mistaken, is
								a great error. We must begin higher up; we must watch the infant in its
								mother&rsquo;s arms; we must see the first images which the external world
								casts upon the dark mirror of his mind; the first occurrences which he
								witnesses; we must hear the first words which awaken the sleeping powers of
								thought, and stand by his earliest efforts, if we would understand the
								prejudices, the habits, and the passions which will rule his life. The entire
								man is, so to speak, to be seen in the cradle of the child.
							</p>

							<p>
								The growth of nations presents something analogous to this: they all bear some
								marks of their origin; and the circumstances which accompanied their birth and
								contributed to their rise affect the whole term of their being. If we were able
								to go back to the elements of states, and to examine the oldest monuments of
								their history, I doubt not that we should discover the primal cause of the
								prejudices, the habits, the ruling passions, and, in short, of all that
								constitutes what is called the national character; we should then find the
								explanation of certain customs which now seem at variance with the prevailing
								manners; of such laws as conflict with established principles; and of such
								incoherent opinions as are here and there to be met with in society, like those
								fragments of broken chains which we sometimes see hanging from the vault of an
								edifice, and supporting nothing. This might explain the destinies of certain
								nations, which seem borne on by an unknown force to ends of which they
								themselves are ignorant. But hitherto facts have been wanting to researches of
								this kind: the spirit of inquiry has only come upon communities in their latter
								days; and when they at length contemplated their origin, time had already
								obscured it, or ignorance and pride adorned it with truth-concealing fables.
							</p>

							<p>
								America is the only country in which it has been possible to witness the
								natural and tranquil growth of society, and where the influences exercised on
								the future condition of states by their origin is clearly distinguishable. At
								the period when the peoples of Europe landed in the New World their national
								characteristics were already completely formed; each of them had a physiognomy
								of its own; and as they had already attained that stage of civilization at
								which men are led to study themselves, they have transmitted to us a faithful
								picture of their opinions, their manners, and their laws. The men of the
								sixteenth century are almost as well known to us as our contemporaries.
								America, consequently, exhibits in the broad light of day the phenomena which
								the ignorance or rudeness of earlier ages conceals from our researches. Near
								enough to the time when the states of America were founded, to be accurately
								acquainted with their elements, and sufficiently removed from that period to
								judge of some of their results, the men of our own day seem destined to see
								further than their predecessors into the series of human events. Providence has
								given us a torch which our forefathers did not possess, and has allowed us to
								discern fundamental causes in the history of the world which the obscurity of
								the past concealed from them. If we carefully examine the social and political
								state of America, after having studied its history, we shall remain perfectly
								convinced that not an opinion, not a custom, not a law, I may even say not an
								event, is upon record which the origin of that people will not explain. The
								readers of this book will find the germ of all that is to follow in the present
								chapter, and the key to almost the whole work.
							</p>

							<p>
								The emigrants who came, at different periods to occupy the territory now
								covered by the American Union differed from each other in many respects; their
								aim was not the same, and they governed themselves on different principles.
								These men had, however, certain features in common, and they were all placed in
								an analogous situation. The tie of language is perhaps the strongest and the
								most durable that can unite mankind. All the emigrants spoke the same tongue;
								they were all offsets from the same people. Born in a country which had been
								agitated for centuries by the struggles of faction, and in which all parties
								had been obliged in their turn to place themselves under the protection of the
								laws, their political education had been perfected in this rude school, and
								they were more conversant with the notions of right and the principles of true
								freedom than the greater part of their European contemporaries. At the period
								of their first emigrations the parish system, that fruitful germ of free
								institutions, was deeply rooted in the habits of the English; and with it the
								doctrine of the sovereignty of the people had been introduced into the bosom of
								the monarchy of the House of Tudor.
							</p>

							<p>
								The religious quarrels which have agitated the Christian world were then rife.
								England had plunged into the new order of things with headlong vehemence. The
								character of its inhabitants, which had always been sedate and reflective,
								became argumentative and austere. General information had been increased by
								intellectual debate, and the mind had received a deeper cultivation. Whilst
								religion was the topic of discussion, the morals of the people were reformed.
								All these national features are more or less discoverable in the physiognomy of
								those adventurers who came to seek a new home on the opposite shores of the
								Atlantic.
							</p>

							<p>
								Another remark, to which we shall hereafter have occasion to recur, is
								applicable not only to the English, but to the French, the Spaniards, and all
								the Europeans who successively established themselves in the New World. All
								these European colonies contained the elements, if not the development, of a
								complete democracy. Two causes led to this result. It may safely be advanced,
								that on leaving the mother-country the emigrants had in general no notion of
								superiority over one another. The happy and the powerful do not go into exile,
								and there are no surer guarantees of equality among men than poverty and
								misfortune. It happened, however, on several occasions, that persons of rank
								were driven to America by political and religious quarrels. Laws were made to
								establish a gradation of ranks; but it was soon found that the soil of America
								was opposed to a territorial aristocracy. To bring that refractory land into
								cultivation, the constant and interested exertions of the owner himself were
								necessary; and when the ground was prepared, its produce was found to be
								insufficient to enrich a master and a farmer at the same time. The land was
								then naturally broken up into small portions, which the proprietor cultivated
								for himself. Land is the basis of an aristocracy, which clings to the soil that
								supports it; for it is not by privileges alone, nor by birth, but by landed
								property handed down from generation to generation, that an aristocracy is
								constituted. A nation may present immense fortunes and extreme wretchedness,
								but unless those fortunes are territorial there is no aristocracy, but simply
								the class of the rich and that of the poor.
							</p>

							<p>
								All the British colonies had then a great degree of similarity at the epoch of
								their settlement. All of them, from their first beginning, seemed destined to
								witness the growth, not of the aristocratic liberty of their mother-country,
								but of that freedom of the middle and lower orders of which the history of the
								world had as yet furnished no complete example.
							</p>

							<p>
								In this general uniformity several striking differences were however
								discernible, which it is necessary to point out. Two branches may be
								distinguished in the Anglo-American family, which have hitherto grown up
								without entirely commingling; the one in the South, the other in the North.
							</p>

							<p>
								Virginia received the first English colony; the emigrants took possession of it
								in 1607. The idea that mines of gold and silver are the sources of national
								wealth was at that time singularly prevalent in Europe; a fatal delusion, which
								has done more to impoverish the nations which adopted it, and has cost more
								lives in America, than the united influence of war and bad laws. The men sent
								to Virginia *a were seekers of gold, adventurers, without resources and without
								character, whose turbulent and restless spirit endangered the infant colony, *b
								and rendered its progress uncertain. The artisans and agriculturists arrived
								afterwards; and, although they were a more moral and orderly race of men, they
								were in nowise above the level of the inferior classes in England. *c No lofty
								conceptions, no intellectual system, directed the foundation of these new
								settlements. The colony was scarcely established when slavery was introduced,
								*d and this was the main circumstance which has exercised so prodigious an
								influence on the character, the laws, and all the future prospects of the
								South. Slavery, as we shall afterwards show, dishonors labor; it introduces
								idleness into society, and with idleness, ignorance and pride, luxury and
								distress. It enervates the powers of the mind, and benumbs the activity of man.
								The influence of slavery, united to the English character, explains the manners
								and the social condition of the Southern States.

[ The charter granted by the Crown of England in 1609 stipulated, amongst other
conditions, that the adventurers should pay to the Crown a fifth of the produce
of all gold and silver mines. See Marshall&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of
Washington,&rdquo; vol. i. pp. 18-66.] [Footnote b: A large portion of the
adventurers, says Stith (&ldquo;History of Virginia&rdquo;), were unprincipled
young men of family, whom their parents were glad to ship off, discharged
servants, fraudulent bankrupts, or debauchees; and others of the same class,
people more apt to pillage and destroy than to assist the settlement, were the
seditious chiefs, who easily led this band into every kind of extravagance and
excess. See for the history of Virginia the following works:&mdash;

</p>

										<p>
											In the North, the same English foundation was modified by the most opposite
											shades of character; and here I may be allowed to enter into some details.
											The
											two or three main ideas which constitute the basis of the social theory of
											the
											United States were first combined in the Northern English colonies, more
											generally denominated the States of New England. *e The principles of New
											England spread at first to the neighboring states; they then passed
											successively to the more distant ones; and at length they imbued the whole
											Confederation. They now extend their influence beyond its limits over the
											whole
											American world. The civilization of New England has been like a beacon lit
											upon
											a hill, which, after it has diffused its warmth around, tinges the distant
											horizon with its glow.
										</p>

										<p class="footnote">
											e <br />
[ The States of New England are those situated to the east of the Hudson; they
are now six in number: 1, Connecticut; 2, Rhode Island; 3, Massachusetts; 4,
Vermont; 5, New Hampshire; 6, Maine.]
</p>

											<p>
												The foundation of New England was a novel spectacle, and all the
												circumstances
												attending it were singular and original. The large majority of colonies
												have
												been first inhabited either by men without education and without
												resources,
												driven by their poverty and their misconduct from the land which gave
												them
												birth, or by speculators and adventurers greedy of gain. Some
												settlements
												cannot even boast so honorable an origin; St. Domingo was founded by
												buccaneers; and the criminal courts of England originally supplied the
												population of Australia.
											</p>

											<p>
												The settlers who established themselves on the shores of New England all
												belonged to the more independent classes of their native country. Their
												union
												on the soil of America at once presented the singular phenomenon of a
												society
												containing neither lords nor common people, neither rich nor poor. These
												men
												possessed, in proportion to their number, a greater mass of intelligence
												than
												is to be found in any European nation of our own time. All, without a
												single
												exception, had received a good education, and many of them were known in
												Europe
												for their talents and their acquirements. The other colonies had been
												founded
												by adventurers without family; the emigrants of New England brought with
												them
												the best elements of order and morality&mdash;they landed in the desert
												accompanied by their wives and children. But what most especially
												distinguished
												them was the aim of their undertaking. They had not been obliged by
												necessity
												to leave their country; the social position they abandoned was one to be
												regretted, and their means of subsistence were certain. Nor did they
												cross the
												Atlantic to improve their situation or to increase their wealth; the
												call which
												summoned them from the comforts of their homes was purely intellectual;
												and in
												facing the inevitable sufferings of exile their object was the triumph
												of an
												idea.
											</p>

											<p>
												The emigrants, or, as they deservedly styled themselves, the Pilgrims,
												belonged
												to that English sect the austerity of whose principles had acquired for
												them
												the name of Puritans. Puritanism was not merely a religious doctrine,
												but it
												corresponded in many points with the most absolute democratic and
												republican
												theories. It was this tendency which had aroused its most dangerous
												adversaries. Persecuted by the Government of the mother-country, and
												disgusted
												by the habits of a society opposed to the rigor of their own principles,
												the
												Puritans went forth to seek some rude and unfrequented part of the
												world, where
												they could live according to their own opinions, and worship God in
												freedom.
											</p>

											<p>
												A few quotations will throw more light upon the spirit of these pious
												adventures than all we can say of them. Nathaniel Morton, *f the
												historian of
												the first years of the settlement, thus opens his subject:

													demonstrations of

													plentifully in the
													Sacred Scriptures: that so, what we have seen, and what our fathers

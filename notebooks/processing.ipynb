      "After the fall of the Roman empire in the West, an interval of fifty\n",
      "years, till the memorable reign of Justinian, is faintly marked by the\n",
      "obscure names and imperfect annals of Zeno, Anastasius, and Justin, who\n",
      "successively ascended to the throne of Constantinople. During the same\n",
      "period, Italy revived and flourished under the government of a Gothic\n",
      "king, who might have deserved a statue among the best and bravest of the\n",
      "ancient Romans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Theodoric the Ostrogoth, the fourteenth in lineal descent of the royal\n",
      "line of the Amali, was born in the neighborhood of Vienna two\n",
      "years after the death of Attila. A recent victory had restored the\n",
      "independence of the Ostrogoths; and the three brothers, Walamir,\n",
      "Theodemir, and Widimir, who ruled that warlike nation with united\n",
      "counsels, had separately pitched their habitations in the fertile though\n",
      "desolate province of Pannonia. The Huns still threatened their revolted\n",
      "subjects, but their hasty attack was repelled by the single forces of\n",
      "Walamir, and the news of his victory reached the distant camp of his\n",
      "brother in the same auspicious moment that the favorite concubine of\n",
      "Theodemir was delivered of a son and heir. In the eighth year of his\n",
      "age, Theodoric was reluctantly yielded by his father to the public\n",
      "interest, as the pledge of an alliance which Leo, emperor of the East,\n",
      "had consented to purchase by an annual subsidy of three hundred pounds\n",
      "of gold. The royal hostage was educated at Constantinople with care and\n",
      "tenderness. His body was formed to all the exercises of war, his mind\n",
      "was expanded by the habits of liberal conversation; he frequented the\n",
      "schools of the most skilful masters; but he disdained or neglected\n",
      "the arts of Greece, and so ignorant did he always remain of the first\n",
      "elements of science, that a rude mark was contrived to represent the\n",
      "signature of the illiterate king of Italy. As soon as he had attained\n",
      "the age of eighteen, he was restored to the wishes of the Ostrogoths,\n",
      "whom the emperor aspired to gain by liberality and confidence. Walamir\n",
      "had fallen in battle; the youngest of the brothers, Widimir, had led\n",
      "away into Italy and Gaul an army of Barbarians, and the whole nation\n",
      "acknowledged for their king the father of Theodoric. His ferocious\n",
      "subjects admired the strength and stature of their young prince; and he\n",
      "soon convinced them that he had not degenerated from the valor of his\n",
      "ancestors. At the head of six thousand volunteers, he secretly left the\n",
      "camp in quest of adventures, descended the Danube as far as Singidunum,\n",
      "or Belgrade, and soon returned to his father with the spoils of a\n",
      "Sarmatian king whom he had vanquished and slain. Such triumphs, however,\n",
      "were productive only of fame, and the invincible Ostrogoths were reduced\n",
      "to extreme distress by the want of clothing and food. They unanimously\n",
      "resolved to desert their Pannonian encampments, and boldly to advance\n",
      "into the warm and wealthy neighborhood of the Byzantine court, which\n",
      "already maintained in pride and luxury so many bands of confederate\n",
      "Goths. After proving, by some acts of hostility, that they could be\n",
      "dangerous, or at least troublesome, enemies, the Ostrogoths sold at a\n",
      "high price their reconciliation and fidelity, accepted a donative\n",
      "of lands and money, and were intrusted with the defence of the Lower\n",
      "Danube, under the command of Theodoric, who succeeded after his father's\n",
      "death to the hereditary throne of the Amali.\n",
      "\n",
      "A hero, descended from a race of kings, must have despised the base\n",
      "Isaurian who was invested with the Roman purple, without any endowment\n",
      "of mind or body, without any advantages of royal birth, or superior\n",
      "qualifications. After the failure of the Theodosian life, the choice of\n",
      "Pulcheria and of the senate might be justified in some measure by the\n",
      "characters of Martin and Leo, but the latter of these princes confirmed\n",
      "and dishonored his reign by the perfidious murder of Aspar and his sons,\n",
      "who too rigorously exacted the debt of gratitude and obedience. The\n",
      "inheritance of Leo and of the East was peaceably devolved on his infant\n",
      "grandson, the son of his daughter Ariadne; and her Isaurian husband, the\n",
      "fortunate Trascalisseus, exchanged that barbarous sound for the Grecian\n",
      "appellation of Zeno. After the decease of the elder Leo, he approached\n",
      "with unnatural respect the throne of his son, humbly received, as\n",
      "a gift, the second rank in the empire, and soon excited the public\n",
      "suspicion on the sudden and premature death of his young colleague,\n",
      "whose life could no longer promote the success of his ambition. But the\n",
      "palace of Constantinople was ruled by female influence, and agitated by\n",
      "female passions: and Verina, the widow of Leo, claiming his empire as\n",
      "her own, pronounced a sentence of deposition against the worthless and\n",
      "ungrateful servant on whom she alone had bestowed the sceptre of the\n",
      "East. As soon as she sounded a revolt in the ears of Zeno, he fled with\n",
      "precipitation into the mountains of Isauria, and her brother Basiliscus,\n",
      "already infamous by his African expedition, was unanimously proclaimed\n",
      "by the servile senate. But the reign of the usurper was short and\n",
      "turbulent. Basiliscus presumed to assassinate the lover of his sister;\n",
      "he dared to offend the lover of his wife, the vain and insolent\n",
      "Harmatius, who, in the midst of Asiatic luxury, affected the dress,\n",
      "the demeanor, and the surname of Achilles. By the conspiracy of the\n",
      "malecontents, Zeno was recalled from exile; the armies, the capital, the\n",
      "person, of Basiliscus, were betrayed; and his whole family was condemned\n",
      "to the long agony of cold and hunger by the inhuman conqueror, who\n",
      "wanted courage to encounter or to forgive his enemies. The haughty\n",
      "spirit of Verina was still incapable of submission or repose. She\n",
      "provoked the enmity of a favorite general, embraced his cause as soon as\n",
      "he was disgraced, created a new emperor in Syria and Egypt, raised an\n",
      "army of seventy thousand men, and persisted to the last moment of her\n",
      "life in a fruitless rebellion, which, according to the fashion of the\n",
      "age, had been predicted by Christian hermits and Pagan magicians. While\n",
      "the East was afflicted by the passions of Verina, her daughter Ariadne\n",
      "was distinguished by the female virtues of mildness and fidelity;\n",
      "she followed her husband in his exile, and after his restoration, she\n",
      "implored his clemency in favor of her mother. On the decease of Zeno,\n",
      "Ariadne, the daughter, the mother, and the widow of an emperor, gave\n",
      "her hand and the Imperial title to Anastasius, an aged domestic of the\n",
      "palace, who survived his elevation above twenty-seven years, and whose\n",
      "character is attested by the acclamation of the people, \"Reign as you\n",
      "have lived!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever fear of affection could bestow, was profusely lavished by Zeno\n",
      "on the king of the Ostrogoths; the rank of patrician and consul, the\n",
      "command of the Palatine troops, an equestrian statue, a treasure in gold\n",
      "and silver of many thousand pounds, the name of son, and the promise of\n",
      "a rich and honorable wife. As long as Theodoric condescended to serve,\n",
      "he supported with courage and fidelity the cause of his benefactor; his\n",
      "rapid march contributed to the restoration of Zeno; and in the second\n",
      "revolt, the _Walamirs_, as they were called, pursued and pressed the\n",
      "Asiatic rebels, till they left an easy victory to the Imperial troops.\n",
      "But the faithful servant was suddenly converted into a formidable enemy,\n",
      "who spread the flames of war from Constantinople to the Adriatic; many\n",
      "flourishing cities were reduced to ashes, and the agriculture of Thrace\n",
      "was almost extirpated by the wanton cruelty of the Goths, who deprived\n",
      "their captive peasants of the right hand that guided the plough. On\n",
      "such occasions, Theodoric sustained the loud and specious reproach of\n",
      "disloyalty, of ingratitude, and of insatiate avarice, which could be\n",
      "only excused by the hard necessity of his situation. He reigned, not as\n",
      "the monarch, but as the minister of a ferocious people, whose spirit was\n",
      "unbroken by slavery, and impatient of real or imaginary insults. Their\n",
      "poverty was incurable; since the most liberal donatives were soon\n",
      "dissipated in wasteful luxury, and the most fertile estates became\n",
      "barren in their hands; they despised, but they envied, the laborious\n",
      "provincials; and when their subsistence had failed, the Ostrogoths\n",
      "embraced the familiar resources of war and rapine. It had been the wish\n",
      "of Theodoric (such at least was his declaration) to lead a peaceful,\n",
      "obscure, obedient life on the confines of Scythia, till the Byzantine\n",
      "court, by splendid and fallacious promises, seduced him to attack\n",
      "a confederate tribe of Goths, who had been engaged in the party\n",
      "of Basiliscus. He marched from his station in MÊsia, on the solemn\n",
      "assurance that before he reached Adrianople, he should meet a plentiful\n",
      "convoy of provisions, and a reÎnforcement of eight thousand horse\n",
      "and thirty thousand foot, while the legions of Asia were encamped at\n",
      "Heraclea to second his operations. These measures were disappointed by\n",
      "mutual jealousy. As he advanced into Thrace, the son of Theodemir found\n",
      "an inhospitable solitude, and his Gothic followers, with a heavy train\n",
      "of horses, of mules, and of wagons, were betrayed by their guides among\n",
      "the rocks and precipices of Mount Sondis, where he was assaulted by the\n",
      "arms and invectives of Theodoric the son of Triarius. From a neighboring\n",
      "height, his artful rival harangued the camp of the _Walamirs_, and\n",
      "branded their leader with the opprobrious names of child, of madman, of\n",
      "perjured traitor, the enemy of his blood and nation. \"Are you ignorant,\"\n",
      "exclaimed the son of Triarius, \"that it is the constant policy of the\n",
      "Romans to destroy the Goths by each other's swords? Are you insensible\n",
      "that the victor in this unnatural contest will be exposed, and justly\n",
      "exposed, to their implacable revenge? Where are those warriors, my\n",
      "kinsmen and thy own, whose widows now lament that their lives were\n",
      "sacrificed to thy rash ambition? Where is the wealth which thy soldiers\n",
      "possessed when they were first allured from their native homes to\n",
      "enlist under thy standard? Each of them was then master of three or four\n",
      "horses; they now follow thee on foot, like slaves, through the deserts\n",
      "of Thrace; those men who were tempted by the hope of measuring gold with\n",
      "a bushel, those brave men who are as free and as noble as thyself.\" A\n",
      "language so well suited to the temper of the Goths excited clamor and\n",
      "discontent; and the son of Theodemir, apprehensive of being left alone,\n",
      "was compelled to embrace his brethren, and to imitate the example of\n",
      "Roman perfidy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In every state of his fortune, the prudence and firmness of Theodoric\n",
      "were equally conspicuous; whether he threatened Constantinople at the\n",
      "head of the confederate Goths, or retreated with a faithful band to the\n",
      "mountains and sea-coast of Epirus. At length the accidental death of\n",
      "the son of Triarius destroyed the balance which the Romans had been so\n",
      "anxious to preserve, the whole nation acknowledged the supremacy of the\n",
      "Amali, and the Byzantine court subscribed an ignominious and oppressive\n",
      "treaty. The senate had already declared, that it was necessary to choose\n",
      "a party among the Goths, since the public was unequal to the support of\n",
      "their united forces; a subsidy of two thousand pounds of gold, with\n",
      "the ample pay of thirteen thousand men, were required for the least\n",
      "considerable of their armies; and the Isaurians, who guarded not the\n",
      "empire but the emperor, enjoyed, besides the privilege of rapine, an\n",
      "annual pension of five thousand pounds. The sagacious mind of Theodoric\n",
      "soon perceived that he was odious to the Romans, and suspected by the\n",
      "Barbarians: he understood the popular murmur, that his subjects were\n",
      "exposed in their frozen huts to intolerable hardships, while their king\n",
      "was dissolved in the luxury of Greece, and he prevented the painful\n",
      "alternative of encountering the Goths, as the champion, or of leading\n",
      "them to the field, as the enemy, of Zeno. Embracing an enterprise worthy\n",
      "of his courage and ambition, Theodoric addressed the emperor in the\n",
      "following words: \"Although your servant is maintained in affluence by\n",
      "your liberality, graciously listen to the wishes of my heart! Italy, the\n",
      "inheritance of your predecessors, and Rome itself, the head and mistress\n",
      "of the world, now fluctuate under the violence and oppression of Odoacer\n",
      "the mercenary. Direct me, with my national troops, to march against\n",
      "the tyrant. If I fall, you will be relieved from an expensive and\n",
      "troublesome friend: if, with the divine permission, I succeed, I shall\n",
      "govern in your name, and to your glory, the Roman senate, and the part\n",
      "of the republic delivered from slavery by my victorious arms.\" The\n",
      "proposal of Theodoric was accepted, and perhaps had been suggested, by\n",
      "the Byzantine court. But the forms of the commission, or grant,\n",
      "appear to have been expressed with a prudent ambiguity, which might be\n",
      "explained by the event; and it was left doubtful, whether the conqueror\n",
      "of Italy should reign as the lieutenant, the vassal, or the ally, of the\n",
      "emperor of the East.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reputation both of the leader and of the war diffused a universal\n",
      "ardor; the _Walamirs_ were multiplied by the Gothic swarms already\n",
      "engaged in the service, or seated in the provinces, of the empire; and\n",
      "each bold Barbarian, who had heard of the wealth and beauty of Italy,\n",
      "was impatient to seek, through the most perilous adventures, the\n",
      "possession of such enchanting objects. The march of Theodoric must be\n",
      "considered as the emigration of an entire people; the wives and children\n",
      "of the Goths, their aged parents, and most precious effects, were\n",
      "carefully transported; and some idea may be formed of the heavy baggage\n",
      "that now followed the camp, by the loss of two thousand wagons, which\n",
      "had been sustained in a single action in the war of Epirus. For their\n",
      "subsistence, the Goths depended on the magazines of corn which was\n",
      "ground in portable mills by the hands of their women; on the milk and\n",
      "flesh of their flocks and herds; on the casual produce of the chase, and\n",
      "upon the contributions which they might impose on all who should\n",
      "presume to dispute the passage, or to refuse their friendly assistance.\n",
      "Notwithstanding these precautions, they were exposed to the danger, and\n",
      "almost to the distress, of famine, in a march of seven hundred miles,\n",
      "which had been undertaken in the depth of a rigorous winter. Since the\n",
      "fall of the Roman power, Dacia and Pannonia no longer exhibited the\n",
      "rich prospect of populous cities, well-cultivated fields, and convenient\n",
      "highways: the reign of barbarism and desolation was restored, and the\n",
      "tribes of Bulgarians, GepidÊ, and Sarmatians, who had occupied the\n",
      "vacant province, were prompted by their native fierceness, or the\n",
      "solicitations of Odoacer, to resist the progress of his enemy. In many\n",
      "obscure though bloody battles, Theodoric fought and vanquished; till at\n",
      "length, surmounting every obstacle by skilful conduct and persevering\n",
      "courage, he descended from the Julian Alps, and displayed his invincible\n",
      "banners on the confines of Italy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Odoacer, a rival not unworthy of his arms, had already occupied the\n",
      "advantageous and well-known post of the River Sontius, near the ruins of\n",
      "Aquileia, at the head of a powerful host, whose independent _kings_\n",
      "or leaders disdained the duties of subordination and the prudence of\n",
      "delays. No sooner had Theodoric gained a short repose and refreshment to\n",
      "his wearied cavalry, than he boldly attacked the fortifications of the\n",
      "enemy; the Ostrogoths showed more ardor to acquire, than the mercenaries\n",
      "to defend, the lands of Italy; and the reward of the first victory was\n",
      "the possession of the Venetian province as far as the walls of Verona.\n",
      "In the neighborhood of that city, on the steep banks of the rapid\n",
      "Adige, he was opposed by a new army, reÎnforced in its numbers, and not\n",
      "impaired in its courage: the contest was more obstinate, but the event\n",
      "was still more decisive; Odoacer fled to Ravenna, Theodoric advanced\n",
      "to Milan, and the vanquished troops saluted their conqueror with loud\n",
      "acclamations of respect and fidelity. But their want either of constancy\n",
      "or of faith soon exposed him to the most imminent danger; his vanguard,\n",
      "with several Gothic counts, which had been rashly intrusted to\n",
      "a deserter, was betrayed and destroyed near Faenza by his double\n",
      "treachery; Odoacer again appeared master of the field, and the invader,\n",
      "strongly intrenched in his camp of Pavia, was reduced to solicit the\n",
      "aid of a kindred nation, the Visigoths of Gaul. In the course of\n",
      "this History, the most voracious appetite for war will be abundantly\n",
      "satiated; nor can I much lament that our dark and imperfect materials do\n",
      "not afford a more ample narrative of the distress of Italy, and of the\n",
      "fierce conflict, which was finally decided by the abilities, experience,\n",
      "and valor of the Gothic king. Immediately before the battle of Verona,\n",
      "he visited the tent of his mother and sister, and requested, that on\n",
      "a day, the most illustrious festival of his life, they would adorn him\n",
      "with the rich garments which they had worked with their own hands. \"Our\n",
      "glory,\" said he, \"is mutual and inseparable. You are known to the world\n",
      "as the mother of Theodoric; and it becomes me to prove, that I am the\n",
      "genuine offspring of those heroes from whom I claim my descent.\" The\n",
      "wife or concubine of Theodemir was inspired with the spirit of the\n",
      "German matrons, who esteemed their sons' honor far above their safety;\n",
      "and it is reported, that in a desperate action, when Theodoric himself\n",
      "was hurried along by the torrent of a flying crowd, she boldly met them\n",

      "the deliverer of Rome by the senate and people, who had shut their gates\n",
      "against the flying usurper. Ravenna alone, secure in the fortifications\n",
      "of art and nature, still sustained a siege of almost three years; and\n",
      "the daring sallies of Odoacer carried slaughter and dismay into the\n",
      "Gothic camp. At length, destitute of provisions and hopeless of relief,\n",
      "that unfortunate monarch yielded to the groans of his subjects and the\n",
      "clamors of his soldiers. A treaty of peace was negotiated by the bishop\n",
      "of Ravenna; the Ostrogoths were admitted into the city, and the hostile\n",
      "kings consented, under the sanction of an oath, to rule with equal\n",
      "and undivided authority the provinces of Italy. The event of such an\n",
      "agreement may be easily foreseen. After some days had been devoted to\n",
      "the semblance of joy and friendship, Odoacer, in the midst of a solemn\n",
      "banquet, was stabbed by the hand, or at least by the command, of his\n",
      "rival. Secret and effectual orders had been previously despatched; the\n",
      "faithless and rapacious mercenaries, at the same moment, and without\n",
      "resistance, were universally massacred; and the royalty of Theodoric was\n",
      "proclaimed by the Goths, with the tardy, reluctant, ambiguous consent\n",
      "of the emperor of the East. The design of a conspiracy was imputed,\n",
      "according to the usual forms, to the prostrate tyrant; but his\n",
      "innocence, and the guilt of his conqueror, are sufficiently proved by\n",
      "the advantageous treaty which _force_ would not sincerely have granted,\n",
      "nor _weakness_ have rashly infringed. The jealousy of power, and the\n",
      "mischiefs of discord, may suggest a more decent apology, and a sentence\n",
      "less rigorous may be pronounced against a crime which was necessary to\n",
      "introduce into Italy a generation of public felicity. The living author\n",
      "of this felicity was audaciously praised in his own presence by\n",
      "sacred and profane orators; but history (in his time she was mute and\n",
      "inglorious) has not left any just representation of the events which\n",
      "displayed, or of the defects which clouded, the virtues of Theodoric.\n",
      "One record of his fame, the volume of public epistles composed by\n",
      "Cassiodorus in the royal name, is still extant, and has obtained more\n",
      "implicit credit than it seems to deserve. They exhibit the forms, rather\n",
      "than the substance, of his government; and we should vainly search\n",
      "for the pure and spontaneous sentiments of the Barbarian amidst the\n",

      "the precedents of office, and the vague professions, which, in\n",
      "every court, and on every occasion, compose the language of discreet\n",

      "the example of Odoacer, the rights of conquest, the true interest of the\n",
      "Italians, and the sacred duty of subsisting a whole people, who, on the\n",
      "faith of his promises, had transported themselves into a distant land.\n",
      "Under the reign of Theodoric, and in the happy climate of Italy, the\n",
      "Goths soon multiplied to a formidable host of two hundred thousand men,\n",
      "and the whole amount of their families may be computed by the ordinary\n",
      "addition of women and children. Their invasion of property, a part of\n",
      "which must have been already vacant, was disguised by the generous but\n",
      "improper name of _hospitality_; these unwelcome guests were irregularly\n",
      "dispersed over the face of Italy, and the lot of each Barbarian was\n",
      "adequate to his birth and office, the number of his followers, and the\n",
      "rustic wealth which he possessed in slaves and cattle. The distinction\n",
      "of noble and plebeian were acknowledged; but the lands of every freeman\n",
      "were exempt from taxes, and he enjoyed the inestimable privilege\n",
      "of being subject only to the laws of his country. Fashion, and even\n",
      "convenience, soon persuaded the conquerors to assume the more elegant\n",
      "dress of the natives, but they still persisted in the use of their\n",
      "mother-tongue; and their contempt for the Latin schools was applauded\n",
      "by Theodoric himself, who gratified their prejudices, or his own, by\n",
      "declaring, that the child who had trembled at a rod, would never dare to\n",
      "look upon a sword. Distress might sometimes provoke the indigent Roman\n",
      "to assume the ferocious manners which were insensibly relinquished by\n",
      "the rich and luxurious Barbarian; but these mutual conversions were not\n",
      "encouraged by the policy of a monarch who perpetuated the separation of\n",
      "the Italians and Goths; reserving the former for the arts of peace, and\n",
      "the latter for the service of war. To accomplish this design, he studied\n",
      "to protect his industrious subjects, and to moderate the violence,\n",
      "without enervating the valor, of his soldiers, who were maintained for\n",
      "the public defence. They held their lands and benefices as a military\n",

      "the conduct of their provincial officers; and the whole extent of Italy\n",
      "was distributed into the several quarters of a well-regulated camp. The\n",
      "service of the palace and of the frontiers was performed by choice or by\n",
      "rotation; and each extraordinary fatigue was recompensed by an increase\n",
      "of pay and occasional donatives. Theodoric had convinced his brave\n",
      "companions, that empire must be acquired and defended by the same arts.\n",
      "After his example, they strove to excel in the use, not only of the\n",
      "lance and sword, the instruments of their victories, but of the missile\n",
      "weapons, which they were too much inclined to neglect; and the lively\n",
      "image of war was displayed in the daily exercise and annual reviews of\n",

      "conquest and desirous of peace, terror was changed into respect, and\n",
      "they submitted to a powerful mediation, which was uniformly employed\n",
      "for the best purposes of reconciling their quarrels and civilizing their\n",

      "The life of Theodoric represents the rare and meritorious example of a\n",

      "of his age. A reign of three and thirty years was consecrated to\n",
      "the duties of civil government, and the hostilities, in which he was\n",
      "sometimes involved, were speedily terminated by the conduct of his\n",
      "lieutenants, the discipline of his troops, the arms of his allies, and\n",
      "even by the terror of his name. He reduced, under a strong and regular\n",
      "government, the unprofitable countries of RhÊtia, Noricum, Dalmatia,\n",
      "and Pannonia, from the source of the Danube and the territory of the\n",

      "such feeble and turbulent neighbors; and his justice might claim the\n",
      "lands which they oppressed, either as a part of his kingdom, or as the\n",
      "inheritance of his father. The greatness of a servant, who was named\n",
      "perfidious because he was successful, awakened the jealousy of the\n",

      "at length overthrown by the ambition of Clovis; and although unable to\n",
      "assist his rash and unfortunate kinsman, the king of the Visigoths, he\n",
      "saved the remains of his family and people, and checked the Franks in\n",
      "the midst of their victorious career. I am not desirous to prolong or\n",
      "repeat this narrative of military events, the least interesting of the\n",
      "reign of Theodoric; and shall be content to add, that the Alemanni were\n",
      "protected, that an inroad of the Burgundians was severely chastised, and\n",
      "that the conquest of Arles and Marseilles opened a free communication\n",
      "with the Visigoths, who revered him as their national protector, and\n",

      "this respectable character, the king of Italy restored the prÊtorian\n",
      "prÊfecture of the Gauls, reformed some abuses in the civil government\n",
      "of Spain, and accepted the annual tribute and apparent submission of its\n",
      "military governor, who wisely refused to trust his person in the palace\n",
      "of Ravenna. The Gothic sovereignty was established from Sicily to the\n",

      "transient happiness of Italy; and the first of nations, a new people of\n",

      "the mutual emulation of their respective virtues. But the sublime merit\n",
      "of guiding or seconding such a revolution was not reserved for the reign\n",
      "of Theodoric: he wanted either the genius or the opportunities of a\n",
      "legislator; and while he indulged the Goths in the enjoyment of rude\n",
      "liberty, he servilely copied the institutions, and even the abuses,\n",
      "of the political system which had been framed by Constantine and his\n",
      "successors. From a tender regard to the expiring prejudices of Rome,\n",
      "the Barbarian declined the name, the purple, and the diadem, of the\n",
      "emperors; but he assumed, under the hereditary title of king, the whole\n",
      "substance and plenitude of Imperial prerogative. His addresses to the\n",
      "eastern throne were respectful and ambiguous: he celebrated, in pompous\n",
      "style, the harmony of the two republics, applauded his own government as\n",
      "the perfect similitude of a sole and undivided empire, and claimed above\n",
      "the kings of the earth the same preeminence which he modestly allowed to\n",
      "the person or rank of Anastasius. The alliance of the East and West was\n",
      "annually declared by the unanimous choice of two consuls; but it should\n",

      "formal confirmation from the sovereign of Constantinople. The Gothic\n",

      "* whose functions are painted in gaudy colors by the rhetoric of\n",

      "the subordinate care of justice and the revenue was delegated to seven\n",
      "consulars, three correctors, and five presidents, who governed the\n",
      "fifteen _regions_ of Italy according to the principles, and even the\n",
      "forms, of Roman jurisprudence. The violence of the conquerors was\n",
      "abated or eluded by the slow artifice of judicial proceedings; the civil\n",
      "administration, with its honors and emoluments, was confined to the\n",
      "Italians; and the people still preserved their dress and language, their\n",
      "laws and customs, their personal freedom, and two thirds of their landed\n",
      "property. It had been the object of Augustus to conceal the introduction\n",
      "of monarchy; it was the policy of Theodoric to disguise the reign of a\n",
      "Barbarian. If his subjects were sometimes awakened from this pleasing\n",
      "vision of a Roman government, they derived more substantial comfort from\n",
      "the character of a Gothic prince, who had penetration to discern, and\n",
      "firmness to pursue, his own and the public interest. Theodoric loved the\n",
      "virtues which he possessed, and the talents of which he was destitute.\n",
      "Liberius was promoted to the office of PrÊtorian prÊfect for his\n",
      "unshaken fidelity to the unfortunate cause of Odoacer. The ministers of\n",
      "Theodoric, Cassiodorus, and Boethius, have reflected on his reign the\n",
      "lustre of their genius and learning. More prudent or more fortunate than\n",
      "his colleague, Cassiodorus preserved his own esteem without forfeiting\n",
      "the royal favor; and after passing thirty years in the honors of the\n",
      "world, he was blessed with an equal term of repose in the devout and\n",
      "studious solitude of Squillace.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the patron of the republic, it was the interest and duty of the\n",
      "Gothic king to cultivate the affections of the senate and people.\n",
      "The nobles of Rome were flattered by sonorous epithets and formal\n",
      "professions of respect, which had been more justly applied to the merit\n",
      "and authority of their ancestors. The people enjoyed, without fear or\n",
      "danger, the three blessings of a capital, order, plenty, and public\n",

      "in the measure of liberality; yet Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily, poured\n",
      "their tribute of corn into the granaries of Rome an allowance of bread\n",
      "and meat was distributed to the indigent citizens; and every office was\n",
      "deemed honorable which was consecrated to the care of their health and\n",
      "happiness. The public games, such as the Greek ambassador might politely\n",

      "Theodoric visited the old capital of the world; the senate and\n",
      "people advanced in solemn procession to salute a second Trajan, a new\n",
      "Valentinian; and he nobly supported that character by the assurance of\n",
      "a just and legal government, in a discourse which he was not afraid to\n",
      "pronounce in public, and to inscribe on a tablet of brass. Rome, in this\n",
      "august ceremony, shot a last ray of declining glory; and a saint, the\n",
      "spectator of this pompous scene, could only hope, in his pious fancy,\n",
      "that it was excelled by the celestial splendor of the new Jerusalem.\n",
      "During a residence of six months, the fame, the person, and the\n",
      "courteous demeanor of the Gothic king, excited the admiration of the\n",
      "Romans, and he contemplated, with equal curiosity and surprise, the\n",
      "monuments that remained of their ancient greatness. He imprinted the\n",
      "footsteps of a conqueror on the Capitoline hill, and frankly confessed\n",
      "that each day he viewed with fresh wonder the forum of Trajan and his\n",
      "lofty column. The theatre of Pompey appeared, even in its decay, as a\n",
      "huge mountain artificially hollowed, and polished, and adorned by human\n",
      "industry; and he vaguely computed, that a river of gold must have been\n",
      "drained to erect the colossal amphitheatre of Titus. From the mouths of\n",
      "fourteen aqueducts, a pure and copious stream was diffused into every\n",
      "part of the city; among these the Claudian water, which arose at the\n",
      "distance of thirty-eight miles in the Sabine mountains, was conveyed\n",
      "along a gentle though constant declivity of solid arches, till it\n",
      "descended on the summit of the Aventine hill. The long and spacious\n",
      "vaults which had been constructed for the purpose of common sewers,\n",
      "subsisted, after twelve centuries, in their pristine strength; and these\n",
      "subterraneous channels have been preferred to all the visible wonders of\n",

      "of national wealth. From the shades of Tibur and PrÊneste, the Roman\n",
      "senators still retired in the winter season to the warm sun, and\n",
      "salubrious springs of BaiÊ; and their villas, which advanced on solid\n",
      "moles into the Bay of Naples, commanded the various prospect of the sky,\n",
      "the earth, and the water. On the eastern side of the Adriatic, a new\n",
      "Campania was formed in the fair and fruitful province of Istria, which\n",
      "communicated with the palace of Ravenna by an easy navigation of\n",
      "one hundred miles. The rich productions of Lucania and the adjacent\n",
      "provinces were exchanged at the Marcilian fountain, in a populous fair\n",
      "annually dedicated to trade, intemperance, and superstition. In the\n",
      "solitude of Comum, which had once been animated by the mild genius of\n",
      "Pliny, a transparent basin above sixty miles in length still reflected\n",
      "the rural seats which encompassed the margin of the Larian lake; and\n",
      "the gradual ascent of the hills was covered by a triple plantation of\n",
      "olives, of vines, and of chestnut trees. Agriculture revived under the\n",
      "shadow of peace, and the number of husbandmen was multiplied by the\n",
      "redemption of captives. The iron mines of Dalmatia, a gold mine in\n",
      "Bruttium, were carefully explored, and the Pomptine marshes, as well as\n",
      "those of Spoleto, were drained and cultivated by private undertakers,\n",
      "whose distant reward must depend on the continuance of the public\n",
      "prosperity. Whenever the seasons were less propitious, the doubtful\n",
      "precautions of forming magazines of corn, fixing the price, and\n",
      "prohibiting the exportation, attested at least the benevolence of the\n",
      "state; but such was the extraordinary plenty which an industrious people\n",
      "produced from a grateful soil, that a gallon of wine was sometimes sold\n",
      "in Italy for less than three farthings, and a quarter of wheat at about\n",
      "five shillings and sixpence. A country possessed of so many valuable\n",
      "objects of exchange soon attracted the merchants of the world, whose\n",
      "beneficial traffic was encouraged and protected by the liberal spirit of\n",
      "Theodoric. The free intercourse of the provinces by land and water was\n",
      "restored and extended; the city gates were never shut either by day or\n",
      "by night; and the common saying, that a purse of gold might be safely\n",
      "left in the fields, was expressive of the conscious security of the\n",
      "inhabitants.\n",
      "\n",
      "A difference of religion is always pernicious, and often fatal, to the\n",
      "harmony of the prince and people: the Gothic conqueror had been educated\n",
      "in the profession of Arianism, and Italy was devoutly attached to the\n",
      "Nicene faith. But the persuasion of Theodoric was not infected by\n",
      "zeal; and he piously adhered to the heresy of his fathers, without\n",
      "condescending to balance the subtile arguments of theological\n",
      "metaphysics. Satisfied with the private toleration of his Arian\n",
      "sectaries, he justly conceived himself to be the guardian of the\n",
      "public worship, and his external reverence for a superstition which he\n",
      "despised, may have nourished in his mind the salutary indifference of a\n",
      "statesman or philosopher. The Catholics of his dominions acknowledged,\n",
      "perhaps with reluctance, the peace of the church; their clergy,\n",
      "according to the degrees of rank or merit, were honorably entertained in\n",
      "the palace of Theodoric; he esteemed the living sanctity of CÊsarius\n",
      "and Epiphanius, the orthodox bishops of Arles and Pavia; and presented a\n",
      "decent offering on the tomb of St. Peter, without any scrupulous inquiry\n",
      "into the creed of the apostle. His favorite Goths, and even his mother,\n",
      "were permitted to retain or embrace the Athanasian faith, and his long\n",
      "reign could not afford the example of an Italian Catholic, who, either\n",
      "from choice or compulsion, had deviated into the religion of the\n",
      "conqueror. The people, and the Barbarians themselves, were edified by\n",
      "the pomp and order of religious worship; the magistrates were instructed\n",
      "to defend the just immunities of ecclesiastical persons and possessions;\n",
      "the bishops held their synods, the metropolitans exercised their\n",
      "jurisdiction, and the privileges of sanctuary were maintained or\n",
      "moderated according to the spirit of the Roman jurisprudence. With the\n",
      "protection, Theodoric assumed the legal supremacy, of the church; and\n",
      "his firm administration restored or extended some useful prerogatives\n",
      "which had been neglected by the feeble emperors of the West. He was not\n",
      "ignorant of the dignity and importance of the Roman pontiff, to whom the\n",
      "venerable name of Pope was now appropriated. The peace or the revolt of\n",
      "Italy might depend on the character of a wealthy and popular bishop,\n",
      "who claimed such ample dominion both in heaven and earth; who had been\n",
      "declared in a numerous synod to be pure from all sin, and exempt from\n",
      "all judgment. When the chair of St. Peter was disputed by Symmachus and\n",
      "Laurence, they appeared at his summons before the tribunal of an Arian\n",
      "monarch, and he confirmed the election of the most worthy or the most\n",
      "obsequious candidate. At the end of his life, in a moment of jealousy\n",
      "and resentment, he prevented the choice of the Romans, by nominating\n",
      "a pope in the palace of Ravenna. The danger and furious contests of a\n",
      "schism were mildly restrained, and the last decree of the senate was\n",
      "enacted to extinguish, if it were possible, the scandalous venality of\n",
      "the papal elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have descanted with pleasure on the fortunate condition of Italy; but\n",
      "our fancy must not hastily conceive that the golden age of the poets,\n",
      "a race of men without vice or misery, was realized under the Gothic\n",
      "conquest. The fair prospect was sometimes overcast with clouds; the\n",
      "wisdom of Theodoric might be deceived, his power might be resisted and\n",
      "the declining age of the monarch was sullied with popular hatred and\n",
      "patrician blood. In the first insolence of victory, he had been tempted\n",
      "to deprive the whole party of Odoacer of the civil and even the natural\n",
      "rights of society; a tax unseasonably imposed after the calamities\n",
      "of war, would have crushed the rising agriculture of Liguria; a rigid\n",
      "preemption of corn, which was intended for the public relief, must\n",
      "have aggravated the distress of Campania. These dangerous projects were\n",
      "defeated by the virtue and eloquence of Epiphanius and Boethius, who, in\n",
      "the presence of Theodoric himself, successfully pleaded the cause of the\n",
      "people: but if the royal ear was open to the voice of truth, a saint\n",
      "and a philosopher are not always to be found at the ear of kings. The\n",
      "privileges of rank, or office, or favor, were too frequently abused by\n",
      "Italian fraud and Gothic violence, and the avarice of the king's nephew\n",
      "was publicly exposed, at first by the usurpation, and afterwards by\n",
      "the restitution of the estates which he had unjustly extorted from his\n",
      "Tuscan neighbors. Two hundred thousand Barbarians, formidable even\n",
      "to their master, were seated in the heart of Italy; they indignantly\n",
      "supported the restraints of peace and discipline; the disorders of\n",
      "their march were always felt and sometimes compensated; and where it was\n",
      "dangerous to punish, it might be prudent to dissemble, the sallies of\n",
      "their native fierceness. When the indulgence of Theodoric had remitted\n",
      "two thirds of the Ligurian tribute, he condescended to explain the\n",
      "difficulties of his situation, and to lament the heavy though inevitable\n",
      "burdens which he imposed on his subjects for their own defence. These\n",
      "ungrateful subjects could never be cordially reconciled to the origin,\n",
      "the religion, or even the virtues of the Gothic conqueror; past\n",
      "calamities were forgotten, and the sense or suspicion of injuries was\n",
      "rendered still more exquisite by the present felicity of the times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the religious toleration which Theodoric had the glory of\n",
      "introducing into the Christian world, was painful and offensive to the\n",
      "orthodox zeal of the Italians. They respected the armed heresy of the\n",
      "Goths; but their pious rage was safely pointed against the rich and\n",
      "defenceless Jews, who had formed their establishments at Naples, Rome,\n",
      "Ravenna, Milan, and Genoa, for the benefit of trade, and under the\n",
      "sanction of the laws. Their persons were insulted, their effects were\n",
      "pillaged, and their synagogues were burned by the mad populace of\n",
      "Ravenna and Rome, inflamed, as it should seem, by the most frivolous or\n",
      "extravagant pretences. The government which could neglect, would have\n",
      "deserved such an outrage. A legal inquiry was instantly directed; and as\n",
      "the authors of the tumult had escaped in the crowd, the whole community\n",
      "was condemned to repair the damage; and the obstinate bigots, who\n",
      "refused their contributions, were whipped through the streets by the\n",
      "hand of the executioner. This simple act of justice exasperated the\n",
      "discontent of the Catholics, who applauded the merit and patience of\n",
      "these holy confessors. Three hundred pulpits deplored the persecution of\n",
      "the church; and if the chapel of St. Stephen at Verona was demolished\n",
      "by the command of Theodoric, it is probable that some miracle hostile to\n",
      "his name and dignity had been performed on that sacred theatre. At\n",
      "the close of a glorious life, the king of Italy discovered that he had\n",
      "excited the hatred of a people whose happiness he had so assiduously\n",
      "labored to promote; and his mind was soured by indignation, jealousy,\n",
      "and the bitterness of unrequited love. The Gothic conqueror condescended\n",
      "to disarm the unwarlike natives of Italy, interdicting all weapons\n",
      "of offence, and excepting only a small knife for domestic use. The\n",
      "deliverer of Rome was accused of conspiring with the vilest informers\n",
      "against the lives of senators whom he suspected of a secret and\n",
      "treasonable correspondence with the Byzantine court. After the death of\n",
      "Anastasius, the diadem had been placed on the head of a feeble old man;\n",
      "but the powers of government were assumed by his nephew Justinian, who\n",
      "already meditated the extirpation of heresy, and the conquest of Italy\n",
      "and Africa. A rigorous law, which was published at Constantinople, to\n",
      "reduce the Arians by the dread of punishment within the pale of the\n",
      "church, awakened the just resentment of Theodoric, who claimed for his\n",
      "distressed brethren of the East the same indulgence which he had so long\n",
      "granted to the Catholics of his dominions. At his stern command, the\n",
      "Roman pontiff, with four _illustrious_ senators, embarked on an embassy,\n",
      "of which he must have alike dreaded the failure or the success.\n",
      "The singular veneration shown to the first pope who had visited\n",
      "Constantinople was punished as a crime by his jealous monarch; the\n",
      "artful or peremptory refusal of the Byzantine court might excuse an\n",
      "equal, and would provoke a larger, measure of retaliation; and a mandate\n",
      "was prepared in Italy, to prohibit, after a stated day, the exercise of\n",
      "the Catholic worship. By the bigotry of his subjects and enemies, the\n",
      "most tolerant of princes was driven to the brink of persecution; and the\n",
      "life of Theodoric was too long, since he lived to condemn the virtue of\n",
      "Boethius and Symmachus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The senator Boethius is the last of the Romans whom Cato or Tully\n",
      "could have acknowledged for their countryman. As a wealthy orphan,\n",
      "he inherited the patrimony and honors of the Anician family, a name\n",
      "ambitiously assumed by the kings and emperors of the age; and the\n",
      "appellation of Manlius asserted his genuine or fabulous descent from\n",
      "a race of consuls and dictators, who had repulsed the Gauls from the\n",
      "Capitol, and sacrificed their sons to the discipline of the republic. In\n",
      "the youth of Boethius the studies of Rome were not totally abandoned;\n",
      "a Virgil is now extant, corrected by the hand of a consul; and the\n",
      "professors of grammar, rhetoric, and jurisprudence, were maintained in\n",
      "their privileges and pensions by the liberality of the Goths. But the\n",
      "erudition of the Latin language was insufficient to satiate his ardent\n",
      "curiosity: and Boethius is said to have employed eighteen laborious\n",
      "years in the schools of Athens, which were supported by the zeal, the\n",
      "learning, and the diligence of Proclus and his disciples. The reason and\n",
      "piety of their Roman pupil were fortunately saved from the contagion\n",
      "of mystery and magic, which polluted the groves of the academy; but\n",
      "he imbibed the spirit, and imitated the method, of his dead and living\n",
      "masters, who attempted to reconcile the strong and subtile sense of\n",
      "Aristotle with the devout contemplation and sublime fancy of Plato.\n",
      "After his return to Rome, and his marriage with the daughter of his\n",
      "friend, the patrician Symmachus, Boethius still continued, in a palace\n",
      "of ivory and marble, to prosecute the same studies. The church was\n",
      "edified by his profound defence of the orthodox creed against the Arian,\n",
      "the Eutychian, and the Nestorian heresies; and the Catholic unity was\n",
      "explained or exposed in a formal treatise by the _indifference_ of three\n",
      "distinct though consubstantial persons. For the benefit of his Latin\n",
      "readers, his genius submitted to teach the first elements of the arts\n",
      "and sciences of Greece. The geometry of Euclid, the music of Pythagoras,\n",
      "the arithmetic of Nicomachus, the mechanics of Archimedes, the astronomy\n",
      "of Ptolemy, the theology of Plato, and the logic of Aristotle, with\n",
      "the commentary of Porphyry, were translated and illustrated by the\n",
      "indefatigable pen of the Roman senator. And he alone was esteemed\n",
      "capable of describing the wonders of art, a sun-dial, a water-clock,\n",
      "or a sphere which represented the motions of the planets. From these\n",
      "abstruse speculations, Boethius stooped, or, to speak more truly, he\n",
      "rose to the social duties of public and private life: the indigent were\n",
      "relieved by his liberality; and his eloquence, which flattery might\n",
      "compare to the voice of Demosthenes or Cicero, was uniformly exerted in\n",
      "the cause of innocence and humanity. Such conspicuous merit was felt\n",
      "and rewarded by a discerning prince: the dignity of Boethius was adorned\n",
      "with the titles of consul and patrician, and his talents were\n",
      "usefully employed in the important station of master of the offices.\n",
      "Notwithstanding the equal claims of the East and West, his two sons were\n",
      "created, in their tender youth, the consuls of the same year. On the\n",
      "memorable day of their inauguration, they proceeded in solemn pomp from\n",
      "their palace to the forum amidst the applause of the senate and people;\n",
      "and their joyful father, the true consul of Rome, after pronouncing an\n",
      "oration in the praise of his royal benefactor, distributed a triumphal\n",
      "largess in the games of the circus. Prosperous in his fame and fortunes,\n",
      "in his public honors and private alliances, in the cultivation of\n",
      "science and the consciousness of virtue, Boethius might have been styled\n",
      "happy, if that precarious epithet could be safely applied before the\n",
      "last term of the life of man.\n",
      "\n",
      "A philosopher, liberal of his wealth and parsimonious of his time, might\n",
      "be insensible to the common allurements of ambition, the thirst of\n",
      "gold and employment. And some credit may be due to the asseveration of\n",
      "Boethius, that he had reluctantly obeyed the divine Plato, who enjoins\n",
      "every virtuous citizen to rescue the state from the usurpation of vice\n",
      "and ignorance. For the integrity of his public conduct he appeals to\n",
      "the memory of his country. His authority had restrained the pride\n",
      "and oppression of the royal officers, and his eloquence had delivered\n",
      "Paulianus from the dogs of the palace. He had always pitied, and often\n",
      "relieved, the distress of the provincials, whose fortunes were exhausted\n",
      "by public and private rapine; and Boethius alone had courage to oppose\n",
      "the tyranny of the Barbarians, elated by conquest, excited by avarice,\n",
      "and, as he complains, encouraged by impunity. In these honorable\n",
      "contests his spirit soared above the consideration of danger, and\n",
      "perhaps of prudence; and we may learn from the example of Cato, that a\n",
      "character of pure and inflexible virtue is the most apt to be misled by\n",
      "prejudice, to be heated by enthusiasm, and to confound private enmities\n",
      "with public justice. The disciple of Plato might exaggerate the\n",
      "infirmities of nature, and the imperfections of society; and the mildest\n",
      "form of a Gothic kingdom, even the weight of allegiance and gratitude,\n",
      "must be insupportable to the free spirit of a Roman patriot. But the\n",
      "favor and fidelity of Boethius declined in just proportion with the\n",
      "public happiness; and an unworthy colleague was imposed to divide and\n",
      "control the power of the master of the offices. In the last gloomy\n",
      "season of Theodoric, he indignantly felt that he was a slave; but as his\n",
      "master had only power over his life, he stood without arms and without\n",
      "fear against the face of an angry Barbarian, who had been provoked to\n",
      "believe that the safety of the senate was incompatible with his own. The\n",
      "senator Albinus was accused and already convicted on the presumption of\n",
      "_hoping_, as it was said, the liberty of Rome. \"If Albinus be criminal,\"\n",
      "exclaimed the orator, \"the senate and myself are all guilty of the same\n",
      "crime. If we are innocent, Albinus is equally entitled to the protection\n",
      "of the laws.\" These laws might not have punished the simple and barren\n",
      "wish of an unattainable blessing; but they would have shown less\n",
      "indulgence to the rash confession of Boethius, that, had he known of a\n",
      "conspiracy, the tyrant never should. The advocate of Albinus was soon\n",
      "involved in the danger and perhaps the guilt of his client; their\n",
      "signature (which they denied as a forgery) was affixed to the original\n",
      "address, inviting the emperor to deliver Italy from the Goths; and three\n",
      "witnesses of honorable rank, perhaps of infamous reputation, attested\n",
      "the treasonable designs of the Roman patrician. Yet his innocence\n",
      "must be presumed, since he was deprived by Theodoric of the means of\n",
      "justification, and rigorously confined in the tower of Pavia, while the\n",
      "senate, at the distance of five hundred miles, pronounced a sentence of\n",
      "confiscation and death against the most illustrious of its members. At\n",
      "the command of the Barbarians, the occult science of a philosopher was\n",
      "stigmatized with the names of sacrilege and magic. A devout and dutiful\n",
      "attachment to the senate was condemned as criminal by the trembling\n",
      "voices of the senators themselves; and their ingratitude deserved the\n",
      "wish or prediction of Boethius, that, after him, none should be found\n",
      "guilty of the same offence.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Boethius, oppressed with fetters, expected each moment the\n",
      "sentence or the stroke of death, he composed, in the tower of Pavia, the\n",
      "_Consolation of Philosophy_; a golden volume not unworthy of the\n",
      "leisure of Plato or Tully, but which claims incomparable merit from the\n",
      "barbarism of the times and the situation of the author. The celestial\n",
      "guide, whom he had so long invoked at Rome and Athens, now condescended\n",
      "to illumine his dungeon, to revive his courage, and to pour into his\n",
      "wounds her salutary balm. She taught him to compare his long prosperity\n",
      "and his recent distress, and to conceive new hopes from the inconstancy\n",
      "of fortune. Reason had informed him of the precarious condition of her\n",
      "gifts; experience had satisfied him of their real value; he had enjoyed\n",
      "them without guilt; he might resign them without a sigh, and calmly\n",
      "disdain the impotent malice of his enemies, who had left him happiness,\n",
      "since they had left him virtue. From the earth, Boethius ascended\n",
      "to heaven in search of the Supreme Good; explored the metaphysical\n",
      "labyrinth of chance and destiny, of prescience and free will, of\n",
      "time and eternity; and generously attempted to reconcile the perfect\n",
      "attributes of the Deity with the apparent disorders of his moral and\n",
      "physical government. Such topics of consolation so obvious, so vague, or\n",
      "so abstruse, are ineffectual to subdue the feelings of human nature. Yet\n",
      "the sense of misfortune may be diverted by the labor of thought; and the\n",
      "sage who could artfully combine in the same work the various riches\n",
      "of philosophy, poetry, and eloquence, must already have possessed the\n",
      "intrepid calmness which he affected to seek. Suspense, the worst of\n",
      "evils, was at length determined by the ministers of death, who executed,\n",
      "and perhaps exceeded, the inhuman mandate of Theodoric. A strong cord\n",
      "was fastened round the head of Boethius, and forcibly tightened, till\n",
      "his eyes almost started from their sockets; and some mercy may be\n",
      "discovered in the milder torture of beating him with clubs till he\n",
      "expired. But his genius survived to diffuse a ray of knowledge over the\n",
      "darkest ages of the Latin world; the writings of the philosopher were\n",
      "translated by the most glorious of the English kings, and the third\n",
      "emperor of the name of Otho removed to a more honorable tomb the bones\n",
      "of a Catholic saint, who, from his Arian persecutors, had acquired the\n",
      "honors of martyrdom, and the fame of miracles. In the last hours of\n",
      "Boethius, he derived some comfort from the safety of his two sons, of\n",
      "his wife, and of his father-in-law, the venerable Symmachus. But the\n",
      "grief of Symmachus was indiscreet, and perhaps disrespectful: he had\n",
      "presumed to lament, he might dare to revenge, the death of an injured\n",
      "friend. He was dragged in chains from Rome to the palace of Ravenna; and\n",
      "the suspicions of Theodoric could only be appeased by the blood of an\n",
      "innocent and aged senator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Humanity will be disposed to encourage any report which testifies the\n",
      "jurisdiction of conscience and the remorse of kings; and philosophy is\n",
      "not ignorant that the most horrid spectres are sometimes created by the\n",
      "powers of a disordered fancy, and the weakness of a distempered body.\n",
      "After a life of virtue and glory, Theodoric was now descending with\n",
      "shame and guilt into the grave; his mind was humbled by the contrast of\n",
      "the past, and justly alarmed by the invisible terrors of futurity. One\n",
      "evening, as it is related, when the head of a large fish was served\n",
      "on the royal table, he suddenly exclaimed, that he beheld the angry\n",
      "countenance of Symmachus, his eyes glaring fury and revenge, and his\n",
      "mouth armed with long sharp teeth, which threatened to devour him. The\n",
      "monarch instantly retired to his chamber, and, as he lay, trembling\n",
      "with aguish cold, under a weight of bed-clothes, he expressed, in broken\n",
      "murmurs to his physician Elpidius, his deep repentance for the murders\n",
      "of Boethius and Symmachus. His malady increased, and after a dysentery\n",
      "which continued three days, he expired in the palace of Ravenna, in\n",
      "the thirty-third, or, if we compute from the invasion of Italy, in the\n",
      "thirty-seventh year of his reign. Conscious of his approaching end, he\n",
      "divided his treasures and provinces between his two grandsons, and fixed\n",
      "the Rhone as their common boundary. Amalaric was restored to the\n",
      "throne of Spain. Italy, with all the conquests of the Ostrogoths, was\n",
      "bequeathed to Athalaric; whose age did not exceed ten years, but who\n",
      "was cherished as the last male offspring of the line of Amali, by the\n",
      "short-lived marriage of his mother Amalasuntha with a royal fugitive of\n",
      "the same blood. In the presence of the dying monarch, the Gothic chiefs\n",
      "and Italian magistrates mutually engaged their faith and loyalty to\n",
      "the young prince, and to his guardian mother; and received, in the same\n",
      "awful moment, his last salutary advice, to maintain the laws, to love\n",
      "the senate and people of Rome, and to cultivate with decent reverence\n",
      "the friendship of the emperor. The monument of Theodoric was erected by\n",
      "his daughter Amalasuntha, in a conspicuous situation, which commanded\n",
      "the city of Ravenna, the harbor, and the adjacent coast. A chapel of\n",
      "a circular form, thirty feet in diameter, is crowned by a dome of one\n",
      "entire piece of granite: from the centre of the dome four columns arose,\n",
      "which supported, in a vase of porphyry, the remains of the Gothic king,\n",
      "surrounded by the brazen statues of the twelve apostles. His spirit,\n",
      "after some previous expiation, might have been permitted to mingle with\n",
      "the benefactors of mankind, if an Italian hermit had not been witness,\n",
      "in a vision, to the damnation of Theodoric, whose soul was plunged, by\n",
      "the ministers of divine vengeance, into the volcano of Lipari, one of\n",
      "the flaming mouths of the infernal world.\n",

      "The emperor Justinian was born near the ruins of Sardica, (the modern\n",
      "Sophia,) of an obscure race of Barbarians, the inhabitants of a wild\n",
      "and desolate country, to which the names of Dardania, of Dacia, and of\n",
      "Bulgaria, have been successively applied. His elevation was prepared by\n",
      "the adventurous spirit of his uncle Justin, who, with two other peasants\n",
      "of the same village, deserted, for the profession of arms, the more\n",
      "useful employment of husbandmen or shepherds. On foot, with a scanty\n",
      "provision of biscuit in their knapsacks, the three youths followed the\n",
      "high road of Constantinople, and were soon enrolled, for their strength\n",
      "and stature, among the guards of the emperor Leo. Under the two\n",
      "succeeding reigns, the fortunate peasant emerged to wealth and\n",
      "honors; and his escape from some dangers which threatened his life was\n",
      "afterwards ascribed to the guardian angel who watches over the fate of\n",
      "kings. His long and laudable service in the Isaurian and Persian wars\n",
      "would not have preserved from oblivion the name of Justin; yet they\n",
      "might warrant the military promotion, which in the course of fifty years\n",
      "he gradually obtained; the rank of tribune, of count, and of general;\n",
      "the dignity of senator, and the command of the guards, who obeyed him\n",
      "as their chief, at the important crisis when the emperor Anastasius\n",
      "was removed from the world. The powerful kinsmen whom he had raised and\n",
      "enriched were excluded from the throne; and the eunuch Amantius, who\n",
      "reigned in the palace, had secretly resolved to fix the diadem on the\n",
      "head of the most obsequious of his creatures. A liberal donative, to\n",
      "conciliate the suffrage of the guards, was intrusted for that purpose\n",
      "in the hands of their commander. But these weighty arguments were\n",
      "treacherously employed by Justin in his own favor; and as no competitor\n",
      "presumed to appear, the Dacian peasant was invested with the purple\n",
      "by the unanimous consent of the soldiers, who knew him to be brave and\n",
      "gentle, of the clergy and people, who believed him to be orthodox, and\n",
      "of the provincials, who yielded a blind and implicit submission to\n",
      "the will of the capital. The elder Justin, as he is distinguished from\n",
      "another emperor of the same family and name, ascended the Byzantine\n",
      "throne at the age of sixty-eight years; and, had he been left to his own\n",
      "guidance, every moment of a nine years' reign must have exposed to his\n",
      "subjects the impropriety of their choice. His ignorance was similar to\n",
      "that of Theodoric; and it is remarkable that in an age not destitute\n",
      "of learning, two contemporary monarchs had never been instructed in the\n",
      "knowledge of the alphabet. But the genius of Justin was far inferior\n",
      "to that of the Gothic king: the experience of a soldier had not\n",
      "qualified him for the government of an empire; and though personally\n",
      "brave, the consciousness of his own weakness was naturally attended with\n",
      "doubt, distrust, and political apprehension. But the official business\n",
      "of the state was diligently and faithfully transacted by the quÊstor\n",
      "Proclus; and the aged emperor adopted the talents and ambition of his\n",
      "nephew Justinian, an aspiring youth, whom his uncle had drawn from the\n",
      "rustic solitude of Dacia, and educated at Constantinople, as the heir of\n",
      "his private fortune, and at length of the Eastern empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the eunuch Amantius had been defrauded of his money, it became\n",
      "necessary to deprive him of his life. The task was easily accomplished\n",
      "by the charge of a real or fictitious conspiracy; and the judges were\n",
      "informed, as an accumulation of guilt, that he was secretly addicted to\n",
      "the ManichÊan heresy. Amantius lost his head; three of his companions,\n",
      "the first domestics of the palace, were punished either with death or\n",
      "exile; and their unfortunate candidate for the purple was cast into a\n",
      "deep dungeon, overwhelmed with stones, and ignominiously thrown, without\n",
      "burial, into the sea. The ruin of Vitalian was a work of more difficulty\n",
      "and danger. That Gothic chief had rendered himself popular by the civil\n",
      "war which he boldly waged against Anastasius for the defence of the\n",
      "orthodox faith, and after the conclusion of an advantageous treaty, he\n",
      "still remained in the neighborhood of Constantinople at the head of a\n",
      "formidable and victorious army of Barbarians. By the frail security of\n",
      "oaths, he was tempted to relinquish this advantageous situation, and\n",
      "to trust his person within the walls of a city, whose inhabitants,\n",
      "particularly the _blue_ faction, were artfully incensed against him\n",
      "by the remembrance even of his pious hostilities. The emperor and his\n",
      "nephew embraced him as the faithful and worthy champion of the church\n",
      "and state; and gratefully adorned their favorite with the titles of\n",
      "consul and general; but in the seventh month of his consulship, Vitalian\n",
      "was stabbed with seventeen wounds at the royal banquet; and Justinian,\n",
      "who inherited the spoil, was accused as the assassin of a spiritual\n",
      "brother, to whom he had recently pledged his faith in the participation\n",
      "of the Christian mysteries. After the fall of his rival, he was\n",
      "promoted, without any claim of military service, to the office of\n",
      "master-general of the Eastern armies, whom it was his duty to lead\n",
      "into the field against the public enemy. But, in the pursuit of fame,\n",
      "Justinian might have lost his present dominion over the age and weakness\n",
      "of his uncle; and instead of acquiring by Scythian or Persian trophies\n",
      "the applause of his countrymen, the prudent warrior solicited their\n",
      "favor in the churches, the circus, and the senate, of Constantinople.\n",
      "The Catholics were attached to the nephew of Justin, who, between the\n",
      "Nestorian and Eutychian heresies, trod the narrow path of inflexible and\n",
      "intolerant orthodoxy. In the first days of the new reign, he prompted\n",
      "and gratified the popular enthusiasm against the memory of the deceased\n",
      "emperor. After a schism of thirty-four years, he reconciled the proud\n",
      "and angry spirit of the Roman pontiff, and spread among the Latins a\n",
      "favorable report of his pious respect for the apostolic see. The thrones\n",
      "of the East were filled with Catholic bishops, devoted to his interest,\n",
      "the clergy and the monks were gained by his liberality, and the people\n",
      "were taught to pray for their future sovereign, the hope and pillar of\n",
      "the true religion. The magnificence of Justinian was displayed in the\n",
      "superior pomp of his public spectacles, an object not less sacred\n",
      "and important in the eyes of the multitude than the creed of Nice or\n",
      "Chalcedon: the expense of his consulship was esteemed at two hundred and\n",
      "twenty-eight thousand pieces of gold; twenty lions, and thirty leopards,\n",
      "were produced at the same time in the amphitheatre, and a numerous train\n",
      "of horses, with their rich trappings, was bestowed as an extraordinary\n",
      "gift on the victorious charioteers of the circus. While he indulged the\n",
      "people of Constantinople, and received the addresses of foreign kings,\n",
      "the nephew of Justin assiduously cultivated the friendship of the\n",
      "senate. That venerable name seemed to qualify its members to declare\n",
      "the sense of the nation, and to regulate the succession of the Imperial\n",
      "throne: the feeble Anastasius had permitted the vigor of government\n",
      "to degenerate into the form or substance of an aristocracy; and the\n",
      "military officers who had obtained the senatorial rank were followed by\n",
      "their domestic guards, a band of veterans, whose arms or acclamations\n",
      "might fix in a tumultuous moment the diadem of the East. The treasures\n",
      "of the state were lavished to procure the voices of the senators, and\n",
      "their unanimous wish, that he would be pleased to adopt Justinian for\n",
      "his colleague, was communicated to the emperor. But this request, which\n",
      "too clearly admonished him of his approaching end, was unwelcome to the\n",
      "jealous temper of an aged monarch, desirous to retain the power which\n",
      "he was incapable of exercising; and Justin, holding his purple with both\n",
      "his hands, advised them to prefer, since an election was so profitable,\n",
      "some older candidate. Not withstanding this reproach, the\n",
      "senate proceeded to decorate Justinian with the royal epithet of\n",
      "_nobilissimus_; and their decree was ratified by the affection or the\n",
      "fears of his uncle. After some time the languor of mind and body, to\n",
      "which he was reduced by an incurable wound in his thigh, indispensably\n",
      "required the aid of a guardian. He summoned the patriarch and senators;\n",
      "and in their presence solemnly placed the diadem on the head of his\n",
      "nephew, who was conducted from the palace to the circus, and saluted\n",
      "by the loud and joyful applause of the people. The life of Justin was\n",
      "prolonged about four months; but from the instant of this ceremony, he\n",
      "was considered as dead to the empire, which acknowledged Justinian, in\n",
      "the forty-fifth year of his age, for the lawful sovereign of the East.\n",
      "\n",
      "From his elevation to his death, Justinian governed the Roman empire\n",
      "thirty-eight years, seven months, and thirteen days. The events of his\n",
      "reign, which excite our curious attention by their number, variety, and\n",
      "importance, are diligently related by the secretary of Belisarius, a\n",
      "rhetorician, whom eloquence had promoted to the rank of senator and\n",
      "prÊfect of Constantinople. According to the vicissitudes of courage or\n",
      "servitude, of favor or disgrace, Procopius successively composed the\n",
      "_history_, the _panegyric_, and the _satire_ of his own times. The eight\n",
      "books of the Persian, Vandalic, and Gothic wars, which are continued\n",
      "in the five books of Agathias, deserve our esteem as a laborious and\n",
      "successful imitation of the Attic, or at least of the Asiatic, writers\n",
      "of ancient Greece. His facts are collected from the personal experience\n",
      "and free conversation of a soldier, a statesman, and a traveller; his\n",
      "style continually aspires, and often attains, to the merit of strength\n",
      "and elegance; his reflections, more especially in the speeches, which he\n",
      "too frequently inserts, contain a rich fund of political knowledge;\n",
      "and the historian, excited by the generous ambition of pleasing and\n",
      "instructing posterity, appears to disdain the prejudices of the people,\n",
      "and the flattery of courts. The writings of Procopius were read and\n",
      "applauded by his contemporaries: but, although he respectfully laid them\n",
      "at the foot of the throne, the pride of Justinian must have been wounded\n",
      "by the praise of a hero, who perpetually eclipses the glory of his\n",
      "inactive sovereign. The conscious dignity of independence was subdued by\n",
      "the hopes and fears of a slave; and the secretary of Belisarius labored\n",
      "for pardon and reward in the six books of the Imperial _edifices_. He\n",
      "had dexterously chosen a subject of apparent splendor, in which he\n",
      "could loudly celebrate the genius, the magnificence, and the piety of\n",
      "a prince, who, both as a conqueror and legislator, had surpassed the\n",
      "puerile virtues of Themistocles and Cyrus. Disappointment might urge the\n",
      "flatterer to secret revenge; and the first glance of favor might again\n",
      "tempt him to suspend and suppress a libel, in which the Roman Cyrus\n",
      "is degraded into an odious and contemptible tyrant, in which both\n",
      "the emperor and his consort Theodora are seriously represented as two\n",
      "dÊmons, who had assumed a human form for the destruction of mankind.\n",
      "Such base inconsistency must doubtless sully the reputation, and detract\n",
      "from the credit, of Procopius: yet, after the venom of his malignity has\n",
      "been suffered to exhale, the residue of the _anecdotes_, even the most\n",
      "disgraceful facts, some of which had been tenderly hinted in his public\n",
      "history, are established by their internal evidence, or the authentic\n",
      "monuments of the times. From these various materials, I shall now\n",
      "proceed to describe the reign of Justinian, which will deserve and\n",
      "occupy an ample space. The present chapter will explain the elevation\n",
      "and character of Theodora, the factions of the circus, and the peaceful\n",
      "administration of the sovereign of the East. In the three succeeding\n",
      "chapters, I shall relate the wars of Justinian, which achieved the\n",
      "conquest of Africa and Italy; and I shall follow the victories of\n",
      "Belisarius and Narses, without disguising the vanity of their triumphs,\n",
      "or the hostile virtue of the Persian and Gothic heroes. The series\n",
      "of this and the following volume will embrace the jurisprudence and\n",
      "theology of the emperor; the controversies and sects which still divide\n",
      "the Oriental church; the reformation of the Roman law which is obeyed or\n",
      "respected by the nations of modern Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I. In the exercise of supreme power, the first act of Justinian was\n",
      "to divide it with the woman whom he loved, the famous Theodora, whose\n",
      "strange elevation cannot be applauded as the triumph of female virtue.\n",
      "Under the reign of Anastasius, the care of the wild beasts maintained by\n",
      "the green faction at Constantinople was intrusted to Acacius, a native\n",
      "of the Isle of Cyprus, who, from his employment, was surnamed the master\n",
      "of the bears. This honorable office was given after his death to another\n",
      "candidate, notwithstanding the diligence of his widow, who had already\n",
      "provided a husband and a successor. Acacius had left three daughters,\n",
      "Comito, Theodora, and Anastasia, the eldest of whom did not then exceed\n",
      "the age of seven years. On a solemn festival, these helpless orphans\n",
      "were sent by their distressed and indignant mother, in the garb of\n",
      "suppliants, into the midst of the theatre: the green faction received\n",
      "them with contempt, the blues with compassion; and this difference,\n",
      "which sunk deep into the mind of Theodora, was felt long afterwards in\n",
      "the administration of the empire. As they improved in age and beauty,\n",
      "the three sisters were successively devoted to the public and private\n",
      "pleasures of the Byzantine people: and Theodora, after following Comito\n",
      "on the stage, in the dress of a slave, with a stool on her head, was\n",
      "at length permitted to exercise her independent talents. She neither\n",
      "danced, nor sung, nor played on the flute; her skill was confined to the\n",
      "pantomime arts; she excelled in buffoon characters, and as often as the\n",
      "comedian swelled her cheeks, and complained with a ridiculous tone\n",
      "and gesture of the blows that were inflicted, the whole theatre of\n",
      "Constantinople resounded with laughter and applause. The beauty of\n",
      "Theodora was the subject of more flattering praise, and the source of\n",
      "more exquisite delight. Her features were delicate and regular; her\n",
      "complexion, though somewhat pale, was tinged with a natural color; every\n",
      "sensation was instantly expressed by the vivacity of her eyes; her easy\n",
      "motions displayed the graces of a small but elegant figure; and\n",
      "either love or adulation might proclaim, that painting and poetry were\n",
      "incapable of delineating the matchless excellence of her form. But\n",
      "this form was degraded by the facility with which it was exposed to the\n",
      "public eye, and prostituted to licentious desire. Her venal charms were\n",
      "abandoned to a promiscuous crowd of citizens and strangers of every\n",
      "rank, and of every profession: the fortunate lover who had been promised\n",
      "a night of enjoyment, was often driven from her bed by a stronger or\n",
      "more wealthy favorite; and when she passed through the streets, her\n",
      "presence was avoided by all who wished to escape either the scandal or\n",
      "the temptation. The satirical historian has not blushed to describe the\n",
      "naked scenes which Theodora was not ashamed to exhibit in the theatre.\n",
      "After exhausting the arts of sensual pleasure, she most ungratefully\n",
      "murmured against the parsimony of Nature; but her murmurs, her\n",
      "pleasures, and her arts, must be veiled in the obscurity of a learned\n",
      "language. After reigning for some time, the delight and contempt of the\n",
      "capital, she condescended to accompany Ecebolus, a native of Tyre, who\n",
      "had obtained the government of the African Pentapolis. But this\n",
      "union was frail and transient; Ecebolus soon rejected an expensive or\n",
      "faithless concubine; she was reduced at Alexandria to extreme distress;\n",
      "and in her laborious return to Constantinople, every city of the East\n",
      "admired and enjoyed the fair Cyprian, whose merit appeared to justify\n",
      "her descent from the peculiar island of Venus. The vague commerce of\n",
      "Theodora, and the most detestable precautions, preserved her from the\n",
      "danger which she feared; yet once, and once only, she became a mother.\n",
      "The infant was saved and educated in Arabia, by his father, who imparted\n",
      "to him on his death-bed, that he was the son of an empress. Filled with\n",
      "ambitious hopes, the unsuspecting youth immediately hastened to the\n",
      "palace of Constantinople, and was admitted to the presence of his\n",
      "mother. As he was never more seen, even after the decease of Theodora,\n",
      "she deserves the foul imputation of extinguishing with his life a secret\n",
      "so offensive to her Imperial virtue.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the most abject state of her fortune, and reputation, some vision,\n",
      "either of sleep or of fancy, had whispered to Theodora the pleasing\n",
      "assurance that she was destined to become the spouse of a potent\n",
      "monarch. Conscious of her approaching greatness, she returned from\n",
      "Paphlagonia to Constantinople; assumed, like a skilful actress, a more\n",
      "decent character; relieved her poverty by the laudable industry of\n",
      "spinning wool; and affected a life of chastity and solitude in a small\n",
      "house, which she afterwards changed into a magnificent temple. Her\n",
      "beauty, assisted by art or accident, soon attracted, captivated, and\n",
      "fixed, the patrician Justinian, who already reigned with absolute sway\n",
      "under the name of his uncle. Perhaps she contrived to enhance the value\n",
      "of a gift which she had so often lavished on the meanest of mankind;\n",
      "perhaps she inflamed, at first by modest delays, and at last by sensual\n",
      "allurements, the desires of a lover, who, from nature or devotion, was\n",
      "addicted to long vigils and abstemious diet. When his first transports\n",
      "had subsided, she still maintained the same ascendant over his mind, by\n",
      "the more solid merit of temper and understanding. Justinian delighted\n",
      "to ennoble and enrich the object of his affection; the treasures of the\n",
      "East were poured at her feet, and the nephew of Justin was determined,\n",
      "perhaps by religious scruples, to bestow on his concubine the sacred and\n",
      "legal character of a wife. But the laws of Rome expressly prohibited\n",
      "the marriage of a senator with any female who had been dishonored by\n",
      "a servile origin or theatrical profession: the empress Lupicina, or\n",
      "Euphemia, a Barbarian of rustic manners, but of irreproachable virtue,\n",
      "refused to accept a prostitute for her niece; and even Vigilantia, the\n",
      "superstitious mother of Justinian, though she acknowledged the wit and\n",
      "beauty of Theodora, was seriously apprehensive, lest the levity and\n",
      "arrogance of that artful paramour might corrupt the piety and happiness\n",
      "of her son. These obstacles were removed by the inflexible constancy of\n",
      "Justinian. He patiently expected the death of the empress; he despised\n",
      "the tears of his mother, who soon sunk under the weight of her\n",
      "affliction; and a law was promulgated in the name of the emperor\n",
      "Justin, which abolished the rigid jurisprudence of antiquity. A glorious\n",
      "repentance (the words of the edict) was left open for the unhappy\n",
      "females who had prostituted their persons on the theatre, and they were\n",
      "permitted to contract a legal union with the most illustrious of the\n",
      "Romans. This indulgence was speedily followed by the solemn nuptials of\n",
      "Justinian and Theodora; her dignity was gradually exalted with that\n",
      "of her lover, and, as soon as Justin had invested his nephew with the\n",
      "purple, the patriarch of Constantinople placed the diadem on the heads\n",
      "of the emperor and empress of the East. But the usual honors which the\n",
      "severity of Roman manners had allowed to the wives of princes, could not\n",
      "satisfy either the ambition of Theodora or the fondness of Justinian.\n",
      "He seated her on the throne as an equal and independent colleague in the\n",
      "sovereignty of the empire, and an oath of allegiance was imposed on the\n",
      "governors of the provinces in the joint names of Justinian and Theodora.\n",
      "The Eastern world fell prostrate before the genius and fortune of the\n",
      "daughter of Acacius. The prostitute who, in the presence of innumerable\n",

      "Those who believe that the female mind is totally depraved by the loss\n",
      "of chastity, will eagerly listen to all the invectives of private envy,\n",
      "or popular resentment which have dissembled the virtues of Theodora,\n",
      "exaggerated her vices, and condemned with rigor the venal or voluntary\n",
      "sins of the youthful harlot. From a motive of shame, or contempt, she\n",
      "often declined the servile homage of the multitude, escaped from the\n",
      "odious light of the capital, and passed the greatest part of the year in\n",
      "the palaces and gardens which were pleasantly seated on the sea-coast of\n",
      "the Propontis and the Bosphorus. Her private hours were devoted to the\n",
      "prudent as well as grateful care of her beauty, the luxury of the bath\n",
      "and table, and the long slumber of the evening and the morning. Her\n",
      "secret apartments were occupied by the favorite women and eunuchs, whose\n",
      "interests and passions she indulged at the expense of justice; the most\n",
      "illustrious person ages of the state were crowded into a dark and sultry\n",
      "antechamber, and when at last, after tedious attendance, they were\n",
      "admitted to kiss the feet of Theodora, they experienced, as her humor\n",
      "might suggest, the silent arrogance of an empress, or the capricious\n",
      "levity of a comedian. Her rapacious avarice to accumulate an immense\n",
      "treasure, may be excused by the apprehension of her husband's death,\n",
      "which could leave no alternative between ruin and the throne; and fear\n",
      "as well as ambition might exasperate Theodora against two generals, who,\n",
      "during the malady of the emperor, had rashly declared that they were not\n",
      "disposed to acquiesce in the choice of the capital. But the reproach of\n",
      "cruelty, so repugnant even to her softer vices, has left an indelible\n",
      "stain on the memory of Theodora. Her numerous spies observed, and\n",
      "zealously reported, every action, or word, or look, injurious to their\n",
      "royal mistress. Whomsoever they accused were cast into her peculiar\n",
      "prisons, inaccessible to the inquiries of justice; and it was rumored,\n",
      "that the torture of the rack, or scourge, had been inflicted in the\n",
      "presence of the female tyrant, insensible to the voice of prayer or\n",
      "of pity. Some of these unhappy victims perished in deep, unwholesome\n",
      "dungeons, while others were permitted, after the loss of their limbs,\n",
      "their reason, or their fortunes, to appear in the world, the living\n",
      "monuments of her vengeance, which was commonly extended to the children\n",
      "of those whom she had suspected or injured. The senator or bishop,\n",
      "whose death or exile Theodora had pronounced, was delivered to a trusty\n",
      "messenger, and his diligence was quickened by a menace from her own\n",
      "mouth. \"If you fail in the execution of my commands, I swear by Him who\n",
      "liveth forever, that your skin shall be flayed from your body.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If the creed of Theodora had not been tainted with heresy, her exemplary\n",
      "devotion might have atoned, in the opinion of her contemporaries, for\n",
      "pride, avarice, and cruelty. But, if she employed her influence to\n",
      "assuage the intolerant fury of the emperor, the present age will allow\n",
      "some merit to her religion, and much indulgence to her speculative\n",
      "errors. The name of Theodora was introduced, with equal honor, in\n",
      "all the pious and charitable foundations of Justinian; and the most\n",
      "benevolent institution of his reign may be ascribed to the sympathy\n",
      "of the empress for her less fortunate sisters, who had been seduced or\n",
      "compelled to embrace the trade of prostitution. A palace, on the\n",
      "Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, was converted into a stately and spacious\n",
      "monastery, and a liberal maintenance was assigned to five hundred women,\n",
      "who had been collected from the streets and brothels of Constantinople.\n",
      "In this safe and holy retreat, they were devoted to perpetual\n",
      "confinement; and the despair of some, who threw themselves headlong\n",
      "into the sea, was lost in the gratitude of the penitents, who had\n",
      "been delivered from sin and misery by their generous benefactress. The\n",
      "prudence of Theodora is celebrated by Justinian himself; and his laws\n",
      "are attributed to the sage counsels of his most reverend wife whom he\n",
      "had received as the gift of the Deity. Her courage was displayed amidst\n",
      "the tumult of the people and the terrors of the court. Her chastity,\n",
      "from the moment of her union with Justinian, is founded on the silence\n",
      "of her implacable enemies; and although the daughter of Acacius might be\n",
      "satiated with love, yet some applause is due to the firmness of a mind\n",
      "which could sacrifice pleasure and habit to the stronger sense either of\n",
      "duty or interest. The wishes and prayers of Theodora could never obtain\n",
      "the blessing of a lawful son, and she buried an infant daughter, the\n",
      "sole offspring of her marriage. Notwithstanding this disappointment, her\n",
      "dominion was permanent and absolute; she preserved, by art or merit, the\n",
      "affections of Justinian; and their seeming dissensions were always fatal\n",
      "to the courtiers who believed them to be sincere. Perhaps her health\n",
      "had been impaired by the licentiousness of her youth; but it was always\n",
      "delicate, and she was directed by her physicians to use the Pythian\n",
      "warm baths. In this journey, the empress was followed by the PrÊtorian\n",
      "prÊfect, the great treasurer, several counts and patricians, and a\n",
      "splendid train of four thousand attendants: the highways were repaired\n",
      "at her approach; a palace was erected for her reception; and as she\n",
      "passed through Bithynia, she distributed liberal alms to the churches,\n",
      "the monasteries, and the hospitals, that they might implore Heaven for\n",
      "the restoration of her health. At length, in the twenty-fourth year of\n",
      "her marriage, and the twenty-second of her reign, she was consumed by\n",
      "a cancer; and the irreparable loss was deplored by her husband, who, in\n",
      "the room of a theatrical prostitute, might have selected the purest and\n",
      "most noble virgin of the East.\n",
      "\n",
      "II. A material difference may be observed in the games of antiquity:\n",
      "the most eminent of the Greeks were actors, the Romans were merely\n",
      "spectators. The Olympic stadium was open to wealth, merit, and ambition;\n",
      "and if the candidates could depend on their personal skill and activity,\n",
      "they might pursue the footsteps of Diomede and Menelaus, and conduct\n",
      "their own horses in the rapid career. Ten, twenty, forty chariots were\n",
      "allowed to start at the same instant; a crown of leaves was the reward\n",
      "of the victor; and his fame, with that of his family and country,\n",
      "was chanted in lyric strains more durable than monuments of brass and\n",
      "marble. But a senator, or even a citizen, conscious of his dignity,\n",
      "would have blushed to expose his person, or his horses, in the circus\n",
      "of Rome. The games were exhibited at the expense of the republic, the\n",
      "magistrates, or the emperors: but the reins were abandoned to servile\n",
      "hands; and if the profits of a favorite charioteer sometimes exceeded\n",
      "those of an advocate, they must be considered as the effects of popular\n",
      "extravagance, and the high wages of a disgraceful profession. The race,\n",
      "in its first institution, was a simple contest of two chariots, whose\n",
      "drivers were distinguished by _white_ and _red_ liveries: two additional\n",
      "colors, a light _green_, and a cÊrulean _blue_, were afterwards\n",
      "introduced; and as the races were repeated twenty-five times, one\n",
      "hundred chariots contributed in the same day to the pomp of the\n",
      "circus. The four _factions_ soon acquired a legal establishment, and\n",
      "a mysterious origin, and their fanciful colors were derived from the\n",
      "various appearances of nature in the four seasons of the year; the red\n",
      "dogstar of summer, the snows of winter, the deep shades of autumn, and\n",
      "the cheerful verdure of the spring. Another interpretation preferred\n",
      "the elements to the seasons, and the struggle of the green and blue\n",
      "was supposed to represent the conflict of the earth and sea. Their\n",
      "respective victories announced either a plentiful harvest or a\n",
      "prosperous navigation, and the hostility of the husbandmen and mariners\n",
      "was somewhat less absurd than the blind ardor of the Roman people, who\n",
      "devoted their lives and fortunes to the color which they had espoused.\n",
      "Such folly was disdained and indulged by the wisest princes; but the\n",
      "names of Caligula, Nero, Vitellius, Verus, Commodus, Caracalla, and\n",
      "Elagabalus, were enrolled in the blue or green factions of the circus;\n",
      "they frequented their stables, applauded their favorites, chastised\n",
      "their antagonists, and deserved the esteem of the populace, by\n",
      "the natural or affected imitation of their manners. The bloody and\n",
      "tumultuous contest continued to disturb the public festivity, till the\n",
      "last age of the spectacles of Rome; and Theodoric, from a motive of\n",
      "justice or affection, interposed his authority to protect the greens\n",
      "against the violence of a consul and a patrician, who were passionately\n",
      "addicted to the blue faction of the circus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Constantinople adopted the follies, though not the virtues, of ancient\n",
      "Rome; and the same factions which had agitated the circus, raged with\n",
      "redoubled fury in the hippodrome. Under the reign of Anastasius, this\n",
      "popular frenzy was inflamed by religious zeal; and the greens, who\n",
      "had treacherously concealed stones and daggers under baskets of\n",
      "fruit, massacred, at a solemn festival, three thousand of their blue\n",
      "adversaries. From this capital, the pestilence was diffused into the\n",
      "provinces and cities of the East, and the sportive distinction of two\n",
      "colors produced two strong and irreconcilable factions, which shook the\n",
      "foundations of a feeble government. The popular dissensions, founded on\n",
      "the most serious interest, or holy pretence, have scarcely equalled the\n",
      "obstinacy of this wanton discord, which invaded the peace of families,\n",
      "divided friends and brothers, and tempted the female sex, though seldom\n",
      "seen in the circus, to espouse the inclinations of their lovers, or\n",
      "to contradict the wishes of their husbands. Every law, either human\n",
      "or divine, was trampled under foot, and as long as the party was\n",
      "successful, its deluded followers appeared careless of private distress\n",
      "or public calamity. The license, without the freedom, of democracy,\n",
      "was revived at Antioch and Constantinople, and the support of a faction\n",
      "became necessary to every candidate for civil or ecclesiastical honors.\n",
      "A secret attachment to the family or sect of Anastasius was imputed to\n",
      "the greens; the blues were zealously devoted to the cause of orthodoxy\n",
      "and Justinian, and their grateful patron protected, above five years,\n",
      "the disorders of a faction, whose seasonable tumults overawed the\n",
      "palace, the senate, and the capitals of the East. Insolent with royal\n",
      "favor, the blues affected to strike terror by a peculiar and Barbaric\n",
      "dress, the long hair of the Huns, their close sleeves and ample\n",
      "garments, a lofty step, and a sonorous voice. In the day they concealed\n",
      "their two-edged poniards, but in the night they boldly assembled in\n",
      "arms, and in numerous bands, prepared for every act of violence and\n",
      "rapine. Their adversaries of the green faction, or even inoffensive\n",
      "citizens, were stripped and often murdered by these nocturnal robbers,\n",
      "and it became dangerous to wear any gold buttons or girdles, or to\n",
      "appear at a late hour in the streets of a peaceful capital. A daring\n",
      "spirit, rising with impunity, proceeded to violate the safeguard of\n",
      "private houses; and fire was employed to facilitate the attack, or\n",
      "to conceal the crimes of these factious rioters. No place was safe or\n",
      "sacred from their depredations; to gratify either avarice or revenge,\n",
      "they profusely spilt the blood of the innocent; churches and altars were\n",
      "polluted by atrocious murders; and it was the boast of the assassins,\n",
      "that their dexterity could always inflict a mortal wound with a single\n",
      "stroke of their dagger. The dissolute youth of Constantinople adopted\n",
      "the blue livery of disorder; the laws were silent, and the bonds\n",
      "of society were relaxed: creditors were compelled to resign their\n",
      "obligations; judges to reverse their sentence; masters to enfranchise\n",
      "their slaves; fathers to supply the extravagance of their children;\n",
      "noble matrons were prostituted to the lust of their servants; beautiful\n",
      "boys were torn from the arms of their parents; and wives, unless they\n",
      "preferred a voluntary death, were ravished in the presence of their\n",
      "husbands. The despair of the greens, who were persecuted by their\n",
      "enemies, and deserted by the magistrates, assumed the privilege of\n",
      "defence, perhaps of retaliation; but those who survived the combat were\n",
      "dragged to execution, and the unhappy fugitives, escaping to woods\n",
      "and caverns, preyed without mercy on the society from whence they were\n",
      "expelled. Those ministers of justice who had courage to punish the\n",
      "crimes, and to brave the resentment, of the blues, became the victims\n",
      "of their indiscreet zeal; a prÊfect of Constantinople fled for refuge to\n",
      "the holy sepulchre, a count of the East was ignominiously whipped, and a\n",
      "governor of Cilicia was hanged, by the order of Theodora, on the tomb of\n",
      "two assassins whom he had condemned for the murder of his groom, and a\n",
      "daring attack upon his own life. An aspiring candidate may be tempted to\n",
      "build his greatness on the public confusion, but it is the interest as\n",
      "well as duty of a sovereign to maintain the authority of the laws.\n",
      "The first edict of Justinian, which was often repeated, and sometimes\n",
      "executed, announced his firm resolution to support the innocent, and to\n",
      "chastise the guilty, of every denomination and _color_. Yet the balance\n",
      "of justice was still inclined in favor of the blue faction, by the\n",
      "secret affection, the habits, and the fears of the emperor; his equity,\n",
      "after an apparent struggle, submitted, without reluctance, to the\n",
      "implacable passions of Theodora, and the empress never forgot, or\n",
      "forgave, the injuries of the comedian. At the accession of the younger\n",
      "Justin, the proclamation of equal and rigorous justice indirectly\n",
      "condemned the partiality of the former reign. \"Ye blues, Justinian is no\n",
      "more! ye greens, he is still alive!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A sedition, which almost laid Constantinople in ashes, was excited by\n",
      "the mutual hatred and momentary reconciliation of the two factions. In\n",
      "the fifth year of his reign, Justinian celebrated the festival of the\n",
      "ides of January; the games were incessantly disturbed by the clamorous\n",
      "discontent of the greens: till the twenty-second race, the emperor\n",
      "maintained his silent gravity; at length, yielding to his impatience, he\n",
      "condescended to hold, in abrupt sentences, and by the voice of a crier,\n",
      "the most singular dialogue that ever passed between a prince and his\n",
      "subjects. Their first complaints were respectful and modest; they\n",
      "accused the subordinate ministers of oppression, and proclaimed their\n",
      "wishes for the long life and victory of the emperor. \"Be patient and\n",
      "attentive, ye insolent railers!\" exclaimed Justinian; \"be mute, ye Jews,\n",
      "Samaritans, and ManichÊans!\" The greens still attempted to awaken his\n",
      "compassion. \"We are poor, we are innocent, we are injured, we dare not\n",
      "pass through the streets: a general persecution is exercised against our\n",
      "name and color. Let us die, O emperor! but let us die by your command,\n",
      "and for your service!\" But the repetition of partial and passionate\n",
      "invectives degraded, in their eyes, the majesty of the purple; they\n",
      "renounced allegiance to the prince who refused justice to his people;\n",
      "lamented that the father of Justinian had been born; and branded his son\n",
      "with the opprobrious names of a homicide, an ass, and a perjured tyrant.\n",
      "\"Do you despise your lives?\" cried the indignant monarch: the blues\n",
      "rose with fury from their seats; their hostile clamors thundered in the\n",
      "hippodrome; and their adversaries, deserting the unequal contest spread\n",
      "terror and despair through the streets of Constantinople. At this\n",
      "dangerous moment, seven notorious assassins of both factions, who\n",
      "had been condemned by the prÊfect, were carried round the city, and\n",
      "afterwards transported to the place of execution in the suburb of Pera.\n",
      "Four were immediately beheaded; a fifth was hanged: but when the same\n",
      "punishment was inflicted on the remaining two, the rope broke, they fell\n",
      "alive to the ground, the populace applauded their escape, and the monks\n",
      "of St. Conon, issuing from the neighboring convent, conveyed them in a\n",
      "boat to the sanctuary of the church. As one of these criminals was\n",
      "of the blue, and the other of the green livery, the two factions were\n",
      "equally provoked by the cruelty of their oppressor, or the ingratitude\n",
      "of their patron; and a short truce was concluded till they had delivered\n",
      "their prisoners and satisfied their revenge. The palace of the prÊfect,\n",
      "who withstood the seditious torrent, was instantly burnt, his officers\n",
      "and guards were massacred, the prisons were forced open, and freedom was\n",
      "restored to those who could only use it for the public destruction.\n",
      "A military force, which had been despatched to the aid of the civil\n",
      "magistrate, was fiercely encountered by an armed multitude, whose\n",
      "numbers and boldness continually increased; and the Heruli, the wildest\n",
      "Barbarians in the service of the empire, overturned the priests and\n",
      "their relics, which, from a pious motive, had been rashly interposed\n",
      "to separate the bloody conflict. The tumult was exasperated by this\n",
      "sacrilege, the people fought with enthusiasm in the cause of God; the\n",
      "women, from the roofs and windows, showered stones on the heads of the\n",
      "soldiers, who darted fire brands against the houses; and the various\n",
      "flames, which had been kindled by the hands of citizens and strangers,\n",
      "spread without control over the face of the city. The conflagration\n",
      "involved the cathedral of St. Sophia, the baths of Zeuxippus, a part of\n",
      "the palace, from the first entrance to the altar of Mars, and the long\n",
      "portico from the palace to the forum of Constantine: a large hospital,\n",
      "with the sick patients, was consumed; many churches and stately edifices\n",
      "were destroyed and an immense treasure of gold and silver was either\n",
      "melted or lost. From such scenes of horror and distress, the wise and\n",
      "wealthy citizens escaped over the Bosphorus to the Asiatic side; and\n",
      "during five days Constantinople was abandoned to the factions, whose\n",
      "watchword, _Nika_, _vanquish!_ has given a name to this memorable\n",
      "sedition.\n",
      "\n",
      "As long as the factions were divided, the triumphant blues, and\n",
      "desponding greens, appeared to behold with the same indifference the\n",
      "disorders of the state. They agreed to censure the corrupt management of\n",
      "justice and the finance; and the two responsible ministers, the artful\n",
      "Tribonian, and the rapacious John of Cappadocia, were loudly arraigned\n",
      "as the authors of the public misery. The peaceful murmurs of the people\n",
      "would have been disregarded: they were heard with respect when the city\n",
      "was in flames; the quÊstor, and the prÊfect, were instantly removed, and\n",
      "their offices were filled by two senators of blameless integrity.\n",
      "After this popular concession, Justinian proceeded to the hippodrome\n",
      "to confess his own errors, and to accept the repentance of his grateful\n",
      "subjects; but they distrusted his assurances, though solemnly pronounced\n",
      "in the presence of the holy Gospels; and the emperor, alarmed by their\n",
      "distrust, retreated with precipitation to the strong fortress of the\n",
      "palace. The obstinacy of the tumult was now imputed to a secret\n",
      "and ambitious conspiracy, and a suspicion was entertained, that the\n",
      "insurgents, more especially the green faction, had been supplied with\n",
      "arms and money by Hypatius and Pompey, two patricians, who could neither\n",
      "forget with honor, nor remember with safety, that they were the\n",
      "nephews of the emperor Anastasius. Capriciously trusted, disgraced, and\n",
      "pardoned, by the jealous levity of the monarch, they had appeared as\n",
      "loyal servants before the throne; and, during five days of the tumult,\n",
      "they were detained as important hostages; till at length, the fears of\n",
      "Justinian prevailing over his prudence, he viewed the two brothers in\n",
      "the light of spies, perhaps of assassins, and sternly commanded them to\n",
      "depart from the palace. After a fruitless representation, that obedience\n",
      "might lead to involuntary treason, they retired to their houses, and in\n",
      "the morning of the sixth day, Hypatius was surrounded and seized by the\n",
      "people, who, regardless of his virtuous resistance, and the tears of\n",
      "his wife, transported their favorite to the forum of Constantine, and\n",
      "instead of a diadem, placed a rich collar on his head. If the usurper,\n",
      "who afterwards pleaded the merit of his delay, had complied with the\n",
      "advice of his senate, and urged the fury of the multitude, their first\n",
      "irresistible effort might have oppressed or expelled his trembling\n",
      "competitor. The Byzantine palace enjoyed a free communication with the\n",
      "sea; vessels lay ready at the garden stairs; and a secret resolution was\n",
      "already formed, to convey the emperor with his family and treasures to a\n",
      "safe retreat, at some distance from the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justinian was lost, if the prostitute whom he raised from the theatre\n",
      "had not renounced the timidity, as well as the virtues, of her sex. In\n",
      "the midst of a council, where Belisarius was present, Theodora alone\n",
      "displayed the spirit of a hero; and she alone, without apprehending his\n",
      "future hatred, could save the emperor from the imminent danger, and his\n",
      "unworthy fears. \"If flight,\" said the consort of Justinian, \"were\n",
      "the only means of safety, yet I should disdain to fly. Death is the\n",
      "condition of our birth; but they who have reigned should never survive\n",
      "the loss of dignity and dominion. I implore Heaven, that I may never\n",
      "be seen, not a day, without my diadem and purple; that I may no longer\n",
      "behold the light, when I cease to be saluted with the name of queen. If\n",
      "you resolve, O CÊsar! to fly, you have treasures; behold the sea, you\n",
      "have ships; but tremble lest the desire of life should expose you to\n",
      "wretched exile and ignominious death. For my own part, I adhere to\n",
      "the maxim of antiquity, that the throne is a glorious sepulchre.\" The\n",
      "firmness of a woman restored the courage to deliberate and act, and\n",

      "they silently marched in two divisions from the palace, forced their\n",
      "obscure way through narrow passages, expiring flames, and falling\n",
      "edifices, and burst open at the same moment the two opposite gates of\n",
      "the hippodrome. In this narrow space, the disorderly and affrighted\n",
      "crowd was incapable of resisting on either side a firm and regular\n",

      "their innocence uncertain, and Justinian had been too much terrified to\n",
      "forgive. The next morning the two nephews of Anastasius, with eighteen\n",
      "_illustrious_ accomplices, of patrician or consular rank, were privately\n",
      "executed by the soldiers; their bodies were thrown into the sea, their\n",

      "of ∆thiopia and Persia. Justinian reigned over sixty-four provinces,\n",
      "and nine hundred and thirty-five cities; his dominions were blessed\n",
      "by nature with the advantages of soil, situation, and climate: and the\n",
      "improvements of human art had been perpetually diffused along the coast\n",
      "of the Mediterranean and the banks of the Nile from ancient Troy to the\n",

      "vegetation, instead of being exhausted by two thousand harvests,\n",

      "caterpillar, and that it composes the golden tomb, from whence a worm\n",
      "emerges in the form of a butterfly. Till the reign of Justinian,\n",
      "the silk-worm who feed on the leaves of the white mulberry-tree were\n",
      "confined to China; those of the pine, the oak, and the ash, were common\n",
      "in the forests both of Asia and Europe; but as their education is\n",
      "more difficult, and their produce more uncertain, they were generally\n",
      "neglected, except in the little island of Ceos, near the coast of\n",
      "Attica. A thin gauze was procured from their webs, and this Cean\n",

      "both in the East and at Rome. Whatever suspicions may be raised by the\n",
      "garments of the Medes and Assyrians, Virgil is the most ancient writer,\n",
      "who expressly mentions the soft wool which was combed from the trees of\n",
      "the Seres or Chinese; and this natural error, less marvellous than the\n",
      "truth, was slowly corrected by the knowledge of a valuable insect, the\n",
      "first artificer of the luxury of nations. That rare and elegant luxury\n",
      "was censured, in the reign of Tiberius, by the gravest of the Romans;\n",
      "and Pliny, in affected though forcible language, has condemned the\n",
      "thirst of gain, which explores the last confines of the earth, for the\n",
      "pernicious purpose of exposing to the public eye naked draperies and\n",
      "transparent matrons. A dress which showed the turn of the limbs, and\n",
      "color of the skin, might gratify vanity, or provoke desire; the silks\n",
      "which had been closely woven in China were sometimes unravelled by the\n",
      "Phnician women, and the precious materials were multiplied by a looser\n",
      "texture, and the intermixture of linen threads. Two hundred years after\n",
      "the age of Pliny, the use of pure, or even of mixed silks, was confined\n",
      "to the female sex, till the opulent citizens of Rome and the provinces\n",
      "were insensibly familiarized with the example of Elagabalus, the first\n",
      "who, by this effeminate habit, had sullied the dignity of an emperor and\n",
      "a man. Aurelian complained, that a pound of silk was sold at Rome for\n",
      "twelve ounces of gold; but the supply increased with the demand, and\n",
      "the price diminished with the supply. If accident or monopoly sometimes\n",
      "raised the value even above the standard of Aurelian, the manufacturers\n",
      "of Tyre and Berytus were sometimes compelled, by the operation of the\n",
      "same causes, to content themselves with a ninth part of that extravagant\n",
      "rate. A law was thought necessary to discriminate the dress of comedians\n",
      "from that of senators; and of the silk exported from its native country\n",
      "the far greater part was consumed by the subjects of Justinian.\n",
      "They were still more intimately acquainted with a shell-fish of the\n",
      "Mediterranean, surnamed the silk-worm of the sea: the fine wool or\n",
      "hair by which the mother-of-pearl affixes itself to the rock is now\n",
      "manufactured for curiosity rather than use; and a robe obtained from the\n",
      "same singular materials was the gift of the Roman emperor to the satraps\n",
      "of Armenia.\n",
      "\n",
      "A valuable merchandise of small bulk is capable of defraying the expense\n",
      "of land-carriage; and the caravans traversed the whole latitude of\n",
      "Asia in two hundred and forty-three days from the Chinese Ocean to the\n",
      "sea-coast of Syria. Silk was immediately delivered to the Romans by the\n",
      "Persian merchants, who frequented the fairs of Armenia and Nisibis; but\n",
      "this trade, which in the intervals of truce was oppressed by avarice\n",
      "and jealousy, was totally interrupted by the long wars of the rival\n",
      "monarchies. The great king might proudly number Sogdiana, and even\n",
      "_Serica_, among the provinces of his empire; but his real dominion\n",
      "was bounded by the Oxus and his useful intercourse with the Sogdoites,\n",
      "beyond the river, depended on the pleasure of their conquerors,\n",
      "the white Huns, and the Turks, who successively reigned over that\n",
      "industrious people. Yet the most savage dominion has not extirpated the\n",
      "seeds of agriculture and commerce, in a region which is celebrated as\n",
      "one of the four gardens of Asia; the cities of Samarcand and Bochara are\n",
      "advantageously seated for the exchange of its various productions; and\n",
      "their merchants purchased from the Chinese, the raw or manufactured silk\n",
      "which they transported into Persia for the use of the Roman empire. In\n",
      "the vain capital of China, the Sogdian caravans were entertained as\n",
      "the suppliant embassies of tributary kingdoms, and if they returned in\n",
      "safety, the bold adventure was rewarded with exorbitant gain. But the\n",
      "difficult and perilous march from Samarcand to the first town of Shensi,\n",
      "could not be performed in less than sixty, eighty, or one hundred days:\n",
      "as soon as they had passed the Jaxartes they entered the desert; and the\n",
      "wandering hordes, unless they are restrained by armies and garrisons,\n",
      "have always considered the citizen and the traveller as the objects of\n",
      "lawful rapine. To escape the Tartar robbers, and the tyrants of Persia,\n",
      "the silk caravans explored a more southern road; they traversed the\n",
      "mountains of Thibet, descended the streams of the Ganges or the Indus,\n",
      "and patiently expected, in the ports of Guzerat and Malabar, the annual\n",
      "fleets of the West. But the dangers of the desert were found less\n",
      "intolerable than toil, hunger, and the loss of time; the attempt was\n",
      "seldom renewed, and the only European who has passed that unfrequented\n",
      "way, applauds his own diligence, that, in nine months after his\n",
      "departure from Pekin, he reached the mouth of the Indus. The ocean,\n",
      "however, was open to the free communication of mankind. From the great\n",
      "river to the tropic of Cancer, the provinces of China were subdued and\n",
      "civilized by the emperors of the North; they were filled about the\n",
      "time of the Christian Êra with cities and men, mulberry-trees and their\n",
      "precious inhabitants; and if the Chinese, with the knowledge of the\n",
      "compass, had possessed the genius of the Greeks or Phnicians, they might\n",
      "have spread their discoveries over the southern hemisphere. I am not\n",
      "qualified to examine, and I am not disposed to believe, their distant\n",
      "voyages to the Persian Gulf, or the Cape of Good Hope; but their\n",
      "ancestors might equal the labors and success of the present race, and\n",
      "the sphere of their navigation might extend from the Isles of Japan to\n",
      "the Straits of Malacca, the pillars, if we may apply that name, of an\n",
      "Oriental Hercules. Without losing sight of land, they might sail along\n",
      "the coast to the extreme promontory of Achin, which is annually visited\n",
      "by ten or twelve ships laden with the productions, the manufactures,\n",
      "and even the artificers of China; the Island of Sumatra and the opposite\n",
      "peninsula are faintly delineated as the regions of gold and silver; and\n",
      "the trading cities named in the geography of Ptolemy may indicate, that\n",
      "this wealth was not solely derived from the mines. The direct interval\n",
      "between Sumatra and Ceylon is about three hundred leagues: the Chinese\n",
      "and Indian navigators were conducted by the flight of birds and\n",
      "periodical winds; and the ocean might be securely traversed in\n",
      "square-built ships, which, instead of iron, were sewed together with\n",
      "the strong thread of the cocoanut. Ceylon, Serendib, or Taprobana,\n",
      "was divided between two hostile princes; one of whom possessed the\n",
      "mountains, the elephants, and the luminous carbuncle, and the other\n",
      "enjoyed the more solid riches of domestic industry, foreign trade, and\n",
      "the capacious harbor of Trinquemale, which received and dismissed\n",
      "the fleets of the East and West. In this hospitable isle, at an equal\n",
      "distance (as it was computed) from their respective countries, the silk\n",
      "merchants of China, who had collected in their voyages aloes, cloves,\n",
      "nutmeg, and sandal wood, maintained a free and beneficial commerce with\n",
      "the inhabitants of the Persian Gulf. The subjects of the great king\n",
      "exalted, without a rival, his power and magnificence: and the Roman, who\n",
      "confounded their vanity by comparing his paltry coin with a gold medal\n",
      "of the emperor Anastasius, had sailed to Ceylon, in an ∆thiopian ship,\n",
      "as a simple passenger.\n",
      "\n",
      "As silk became of indispensable use, the emperor Justinian saw with\n",
      "concern that the Persians had occupied by land and sea the monopoly\n",
      "of this important supply, and that the wealth of his subjects was\n",
      "continually drained by a nation of enemies and idolaters. An active\n",
      "government would have restored the trade of Egypt and the navigation of\n",
      "the Red Sea, which had decayed with the prosperity of the empire; and\n",
      "the Roman vessels might have sailed, for the purchase of silk, to the\n",
      "ports of Ceylon, of Malacca, or even of China. Justinian embraced a more\n",
      "humble expedient, and solicited the aid of his Christian allies,\n",
      "the ∆thiopians of Abyssinia, who had recently acquired the arts of\n",
      "navigation, the spirit of trade, and the seaport of Adulis, still\n",
      "decorated with the trophies of a Grecian conqueror. Along the African\n",
      "coast, they penetrated to the equator in search of gold, emeralds, and\n",
      "aromatics; but they wisely declined an unequal competition, in which\n",
      "they must be always prevented by the vicinity of the Persians to the\n",
      "markets of India; and the emperor submitted to the disappointment, till\n",
      "his wishes were gratified by an unexpected event. The gospel had been\n",
      "preached to the Indians: a bishop already governed the Christians of St.\n",
      "Thomas on the pepper-coast of Malabar; a church was planted in\n",
      "Ceylon, and the missionaries pursued the footsteps of commerce to\n",
      "the extremities of Asia. Two Persian monks had long resided in China,\n",
      "perhaps in the royal city of Nankin, the seat of a monarch addicted to\n",
      "foreign superstitions, and who actually received an embassy from the\n",
      "Isle of Ceylon. Amidst their pious occupations, they viewed with a\n",
      "curious eye the common dress of the Chinese, the manufactures of silk,\n",
      "and the myriads of silk-worms, whose education (either on trees or\n",
      "in houses) had once been considered as the labor of queens. They soon\n",
      "discovered that it was impracticable to transport the short-lived\n",
      "insect, but that in the eggs a numerous progeny might be preserved and\n",
      "multiplied in a distant climate. Religion or interest had more power\n",
      "over the Persian monks than the love of their country: after a long\n",
      "journey, they arrived at Constantinople, imparted their project to the\n",
      "emperor, and were liberally encouraged by the gifts and promises of\n",
      "Justinian. To the historians of that prince, a campaign at the foot of\n",
      "Mount Caucasus has seemed more deserving of a minute relation than\n",
      "the labors of these missionaries of commerce, who again entered China,\n",
      "deceived a jealous people by concealing the eggs of the silk-worm in a\n",
      "hollow cane, and returned in triumph with the spoils of the East. Under\n",
      "their direction, the eggs were hatched at the proper season by the\n",
      "artificial heat of dung; the worms were fed with mulberry leaves;\n",
      "they lived and labored in a foreign climate; a sufficient number of\n",
      "butterflies was saved to propagate the race, and trees were planted\n",
      "to supply the nourishment of the rising generations. Experience and\n",
      "reflection corrected the errors of a new attempt, and the Sogdoite\n",
      "ambassadors acknowledged, in the succeeding reign, that the Romans were\n",
      "not inferior to the natives of China in the education of the insects,\n",
      "and the manufactures of silk, in which both China and Constantinople\n",
      "have been surpassed by the industry of modern Europe. I am not\n",
      "insensible of the benefits of elegant luxury; yet I reflect with some\n",
      "pain, that if the importers of silk had introduced the art of printing,\n",
      "already practised by the Chinese, the comedies of Menander and the\n",
      "entire decads of Livy would have been perpetuated in the editions of the\n",
      "sixth century. A larger view of the globe might at least have promoted\n",
      "the improvement of speculative science, but the Christian geography was\n",
      "forcibly extracted from texts of Scripture, and the study of nature was\n",
      "the surest symptom of an unbelieving mind. The orthodox faith confined\n",
      "the habitable world to _one_ temperate zone, and represented the earth\n",
      "as an oblong surface, four hundred days' journey in length, two hundred\n",
      "in breadth, encompassed by the ocean, and covered by the solid crystal\n",
      "of the firmament.\n",
      "\n",
      "IV. The subjects of Justinian were dissatisfied with the times, and with\n",
      "the government. Europe was overrun by the Barbarians, and Asia by the\n",
      "monks: the poverty of the West discouraged the trade and manufactures of\n",
      "the East: the produce of labor was consumed by the unprofitable servants\n",
      "of the church, the state, and the army; and a rapid decrease was felt in\n",
      "the fixed and circulating capitals which constitute the national wealth.\n",
      "The public distress had been alleviated by the economy of Anastasius,\n",
      "and that prudent emperor accumulated an immense treasure, while he\n",
      "delivered his people from the most odious or oppressive taxes.\n",
      "Their gratitude universally applauded the abolition of the _gold of\n",
      "affliction_, a personal tribute on the industry of the poor, but more\n",
      "intolerable, as it should seem, in the form than in the substance, since\n",
      "the flourishing city of Edessa paid only one hundred and forty pounds\n",
      "of gold, which was collected in four years from ten thousand artificers.\n",
      "Yet such was the parsimony which supported this liberal disposition,\n",
      "that, in a reign of twenty-seven years, Anastasius saved, from his\n",
      "annual revenue, the enormous sum of thirteen millions sterling, or three\n",
      "hundred and twenty thousand pounds of gold. His example was neglected,\n",
      "and his treasure was abused, by the nephew of Justin. The riches of\n",
      "Justinian were speedily exhausted by alms and buildings, by ambitious\n",
      "wars, and ignominious treaties. His revenues were found inadequate to\n",
      "his expenses. Every art was tried to extort from the people the gold and\n",
      "silver which he scattered with a lavish hand from Persia to France:\n",
      "his reign was marked by the vicissitudes or rather by the combat, of\n",
      "rapaciousness and avarice, of splendor and poverty; he lived with the\n",
      "reputation of hidden treasures, and bequeathed to his successor the\n",
      "payment of his debts. Such a character has been justly accused by\n",
      "the voice of the people and of posterity: but public discontent is\n",
      "credulous; private malice is bold; and a lover of truth will peruse\n",
      "with a suspicious eye the instructive anecdotes of Procopius. The secret\n",
      "historian represents only the vices of Justinian, and those vices are\n",
      "darkened by his malevolent pencil. Ambiguous actions are imputed to the\n",
      "worst motives; error is confounded with guilt, accident with design,\n",
      "and laws with abuses; the partial injustice of a moment is dexterously\n",
      "applied as the general maxim of a reign of thirty-two years; the emperor\n",
      "alone is made responsible for the faults of his officers, the disorders\n",
      "of the times, and the corruption of his subjects; and even the\n",
      "calamities of nature, plagues, earthquakes, and inundations, are imputed\n",
      "to the prince of the dÊmons, who had mischievously assumed the form of\n",
      "Justinian.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this precaution, I shall briefly relate the anecdotes of avarice\n",
      "and rapine under the following heads: I. Justinian was so profuse that\n",
      "he could not be liberal. The civil and military officers, when they were\n",
      "admitted into the service of the palace, obtained an humble rank and a\n",
      "moderate stipend; they ascended by seniority to a station of affluence\n",
      "and repose; the annual pensions, of which the most honorable class was\n",
      "abolished by Justinian, amounted to four hundred thousand pounds; and\n",
      "this domestic economy was deplored by the venal or indigent courtiers as\n",
      "the last outrage on the majesty of the empire. The posts, the salaries\n",
      "of physicians, and the nocturnal illuminations, were objects of more\n",
      "general concern; and the cities might justly complain, that he usurped\n",
      "the municipal revenues which had been appropriated to these useful\n",
      "institutions. Even the soldiers were injured; and such was the decay\n",
      "of military spirit, that they were injured with impunity. The emperor\n",
      "refused, at the return of each fifth year, the customary donative\n",
      "of five pieces of gold, reduced his veterans to beg their bread, and\n",
      "suffered unpaid armies to melt away in the wars of Italy and Persia. II.\n",
      "The humanity of his predecessors had always remitted, in some auspicious\n",
      "circumstance of their reign, the arrears of the public tribute, and they\n",
      "dexterously assumed the merit of resigning those claims which it was\n",
      "impracticable to enforce. \"Justinian, in the space of thirty-two years,\n",
      "has never granted a similar indulgence; and many of his subjects have\n",
      "renounced the possession of those lands whose value is insufficient to\n",
      "satisfy the demands of the treasury. To the cities which had suffered by\n",
      "hostile inroads Anastasius promised a general exemption of seven years:\n",
      "the provinces of Justinian have been ravaged by the Persians and Arabs,\n",
      "the Huns and Sclavonians; but his vain and ridiculous dispensation of a\n",
      "single year has been confined to those places which were actually\n",
      "taken by the enemy.\" Such is the language of the secret historian, who\n",
      "expressly denies that any indulgence was granted to Palestine after the\n",
      "revolt of the Samaritans; a false and odious charge, confuted by the\n",
      "authentic record which attests a relief of thirteen centenaries of gold\n",
      "(fifty-two thousand pounds) obtained for that desolate province by\n",
      "the intercession of St. Sabas. III. Procopius has not condescended to\n",
      "explain the system of taxation, which fell like a hail-storm upon the\n",
      "land, like a devouring pestilence on its inhabitants: but we should\n",
      "become the accomplices of his malignity, if we imputed to Justinian\n",
      "alone the ancient though rigorous principle, that a whole district\n",
      "should be condemned to sustain the partial loss of the persons or\n",
      "property of individuals. The _Annona_, or supply of corn for the use\n",
      "of the army and capital, was a grievous and arbitrary exaction, which\n",
      "exceeded, perhaps in a tenfold proportion, the ability of the farmer;\n",
      "and his distress was aggravated by the partial injustice of weights and\n",
      "measures, and the expense and labor of distant carriage. In a time\n",
      "of scarcity, an extraordinary requisition was made to the adjacent\n",
      "provinces of Thrace, Bithynia, and Phrygia: but the proprietors, after\n",
      "a wearisome journey and perilous navigation, received so inadequate a\n",
      "compensation, that they would have chosen the alternative of delivering\n",
      "both the corn and price at the doors of their granaries. These\n",
      "precautions might indicate a tender solicitude for the welfare of the\n",
      "capital; yet Constantinople did not escape the rapacious despotism of\n",
      "Justinian. Till his reign, the Straits of the Bosphorus and Hellespont\n",
      "were open to the freedom of trade, and nothing was prohibited except the\n",
      "exportation of arms for the service of the Barbarians. At each of these\n",
      "gates of the city, a prÊtor was stationed, the minister of Imperial\n",
      "avarice; heavy customs were imposed on the vessels and their\n",
      "merchandise; the oppression was retaliated on the helpless consumer; the\n",
      "poor were afflicted by the artificial scarcity, and exorbitant price\n",
      "of the market; and a people, accustomed to depend on the liberality of\n",
      "their prince, might sometimes complain of the deficiency of water\n",
      "and bread. The _aerial_ tribute, without a name, a law, or a definite\n",
      "object, was an annual gift of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds,\n",
      "which the emperor accepted from his PrÊtorian prÊfect; and the means of\n",
      "payment were abandoned to the discretion of that powerful magistrate.\n",
      "IV. Even such a tax was less intolerable than the privilege of\n",
      "monopolies, which checked the fair competition of industry, and, for\n",
      "the sake of a small and dishonest gain, imposed an arbitrary burden\n",
      "on the wants and luxury of the subject. \"As soon\" (I transcribe the\n",
      "Anecdotes) \"as the exclusive sale of silk was usurped by the Imperial\n",
      "treasurer, a whole people, the manufacturers of Tyre and Berytus, was\n",
      "reduced to extreme misery, and either perished with hunger, or fled to\n",
      "the hostile dominions of Persia.\" A province might suffer by the\n",
      "decay of its manufactures, but in this example of silk, Procopius has\n",
      "partially overlooked the inestimable and lasting benefit which the\n",
      "empire received from the curiosity of Justinian. His addition of one\n",
      "seventh to the ordinary price of copper money may be interpreted with\n",
      "the same candor; and the alteration, which might be wise, appears to\n",
      "have been innocent; since he neither alloyed the purity, nor enhanced\n",
      "the value, of the gold coin, the legal measure of public and private\n",
      "payments. V. The ample jurisdiction required by the farmers of the\n",
      "revenue to accomplish their engagements might be placed in an odious\n",
      "light, as if they had purchased from the emperor the lives and fortunes\n",
      "of their fellow-citizens. And a more direct sale of honors and offices\n",
      "was transacted in the palace, with the permission, or at least with the\n",
      "connivance, of Justinian and Theodora. The claims of merit, even those\n",
      "of favor, were disregarded, and it was almost reasonable to expect,\n",
      "that the bold adventurer, who had undertaken the trade of a magistrate,\n",
      "should find a rich compensation for infamy, labor, danger, the debts\n",
      "which he had contracted, and the heavy interest which he paid. A sense\n",
      "of the disgrace and mischief of this venal practice, at length awakened\n",
      "the slumbering virtue of Justinian; and he attempted, by the sanction\n",
      "of oaths and penalties, to guard the integrity of his government: but\n",
      "at the end of a year of perjury, his rigorous edict was suspended, and\n",
      "corruption licentiously abused her triumph over the impotence of the\n",
      "laws. VI. The testament of Eulalius, count of the domestics, declared\n",
      "the emperor his sole heir, on condition, however, that he should\n",
      "discharge his debts and legacies, allow to his three daughters a decent\n",
      "maintenance, and bestow each of them in marriage, with a portion of ten\n",
      "pounds of gold. But the splendid fortune of Eulalius had been consumed\n",
      "by fire, and the inventory of his goods did not exceed the trifling sum\n",
      "of five hundred and sixty-four pieces of gold. A similar instance, in\n",
      "Grecian history, admonished the emperor of the honorable part prescribed\n",
      "for his imitation. He checked the selfish murmurs of the treasury,\n",
      "applauded the confidence of his friend, discharged the legacies and\n",
      "debts, educated the three virgins under the eye of the empress Theodora,\n",
      "and doubled the marriage portion which had satisfied the tenderness of\n",
      "their father. The humanity of a prince (for princes cannot be generous)\n",
      "is entitled to some praise; yet even in this act of virtue we may\n",
      "discover the inveterate custom of supplanting the legal or natural\n",
      "heirs, which Procopius imputes to the reign of Justinian. His charge is\n",
      "supported by eminent names and scandalous examples; neither widows\n",
      "nor orphans were spared; and the art of soliciting, or extorting, or\n",
      "supposing testaments, was beneficially practised by the agents of\n",
      "the palace. This base and mischievous tyranny invades the security of\n",
      "private life; and the monarch who has indulged an appetite for gain,\n",
      "will soon be tempted to anticipate the moment of succession, to\n",
      "interpret wealth as an evidence of guilt, and to proceed, from the claim\n",
      "of inheritance, to the power of confiscation. VII. Among the forms of\n",
      "rapine, a philosopher may be permitted to name the conversion of Pagan\n",
      "or heretical riches to the use of the faithful; but in the time of\n",
      "Justinian this holy plunder was condemned by the sectaries alone, who\n",
      "became the victims of his orthodox avarice.\n",

      "but much of the guilt, and still more of the profit, was intercepted\n",
      "by the ministers, who were seldom promoted for their virtues, and not\n",
      "always selected for their talents. The merits of Tribonian the quÊstor\n",
      "will hereafter be weighed in the reformation of the Roman law; but\n",
      "the economy of the East was subordinate to the PrÊtorian prÊfect, and\n",
      "Procopius has justified his anecdotes by the portrait which he exposes\n",
      "in his public history, of the notorious vices of John of Cappadocia.\n",
      "* His knowledge was not borrowed from the schools, and his style was\n",
      "scarcely legible; but he excelled in the powers of native genius,\n",
      "to suggest the wisest counsels, and to find expedients in the most\n",
      "desperate situations. The corruption of his heart was equal to the\n",
      "vigor of his understanding. Although he was suspected of magic and\n",
      "Pagan superstition, he appeared insensible to the fear of God or the\n",
      "reproaches of man; and his aspiring fortune was raised on the death\n",
      "of thousands, the poverty of millions, the ruins of cities, and the\n",
      "desolation of provinces. From the dawn of light to the moment of dinner,\n",
      "he assiduously labored to enrich his master and himself at the expense\n",
      "of the Roman world; the remainder of the day was spent in sensual and\n",
      "obscene pleasures, and the silent hours of the night were interrupted\n",
      "by the perpetual dread of the justice of an assassin. His abilities,\n",
      "perhaps his vices, recommended him to the lasting friendship of\n",
      "Justinian: the emperor yielded with reluctance to the fury of the\n",
      "people; his victory was displayed by the immediate restoration of\n",
      "their enemy; and they felt above ten years, under his oppressive\n",
      "administration, that he was stimulated by revenge, rather than\n",
      "instructed by misfortune. Their murmurs served only to fortify the\n",
      "resolution of Justinian; but the resentment of Theodora, disdained a\n",
      "power before which every knee was bent, and attempted to sow the seeds\n",
      "of discord between the emperor and his beloved consort. Even Theodora\n",
      "herself was constrained to dissemble, to wait a favorable moment, and,\n",
      "by an artful conspiracy, to render John of Cappadocia the accomplice\n",
      "of his own destruction. At a time when Belisarius, unless he had been\n",
      "a hero, must have shown himself a rebel, his wife Antonina, who\n",
      "enjoyed the secret confidence of the empress, communicated his feigned\n",

      "have known the value of oaths and promises, was tempted to accept\n",
      "a nocturnal, and almost treasonable, interview with the wife of\n",
      "Belisarius. An ambuscade of guards and eunuchs had been posted by the\n",
      "command of Theodora; they rushed with drawn swords to seize or to punish\n",
      "the guilty minister: he was saved by the fidelity of his attendants; but\n",
      "instead of appealing to a gracious sovereign, who had privately warned\n",
      "him of his danger, he pusillanimously fled to the sanctuary of the\n",
      "church. The favorite of Justinian was sacrificed to conjugal tenderness\n",
      "or domestic tranquility; the conversion of a prÊfect into a priest\n",
      "extinguished his ambitious hopes: but the friendship of the emperor\n",
      "alleviated his disgrace, and he retained in the mild exile of Cyzicus\n",
      "an ample portion of his riches. Such imperfect revenge could not satisfy\n",
      "the unrelenting hatred of Theodora; the murder of his old enemy, the\n",
      "bishop of Cyzicus, afforded a decent pretence; and John of Cappadocia,\n",
      "whose actions had deserved a thousand deaths, was at last condemned\n",
      "for a crime of which he was innocent. A great minister, who had been\n",
      "invested with the honors of consul and patrician, was ignominiously\n",
      "scourged like the vilest of malefactors; a tattered cloak was the sole\n",
      "remnant of his fortunes; he was transported in a bark to the place of\n",
      "his banishment at Antinopolis in Upper Egypt, and the prÊfect of the\n",
      "East begged his bread through the cities which had trembled at his name.\n",
      "During an exile of seven years, his life was protracted and threatened\n",
      "by the ingenious cruelty of Theodora; and when her death permitted\n",
      "the emperor to recall a servant whom he had abandoned with regret, the\n",
      "ambition of John of Cappadocia was reduced to the humble duties of\n",
      "the sacerdotal profession. His successors convinced the subjects of\n",
      "Justinian, that the arts of oppression might still be improved by\n",
      "experience and industry; the frauds of a Syrian banker were introduced\n",
      "into the administration of the finances; and the example of the prÊfect\n",
      "was diligently copied by the quÊstor, the public and private treasurer,\n",

      "V. The _edifices_ of Justinian were cemented with the blood and treasure\n",
      "of his people; but those stately structures appeared to announce the\n",
      "prosperity of the empire, and actually displayed the skill of their\n",
      "architects. Both the theory and practice of the arts which depend on\n",
      "mathematical science and mechanical power, were cultivated under the\n",
      "patronage of the emperors; the fame of Archimedes was rivalled by\n",
      "Proclus and Anthemius; and if their _miracles_ had been related by\n",
      "intelligent spectators, they might now enlarge the speculations, instead\n",
      "of exciting the distrust, of philosophers. A tradition has prevailed,\n",
      "that the Roman fleet was reduced to ashes in the port of Syracuse, by\n",
      "the burning-glasses of Archimedes; and it is asserted, that a similar\n",
      "expedient was employed by Proclus to destroy the Gothic vessels in\n",
      "the harbor of Constantinople, and to protect his benefactor Anastasius\n",
      "against the bold enterprise of Vitalian. A machine was fixed on the\n",
      "walls of the city, consisting of a hexagon mirror of polished brass,\n",
      "with many smaller and movable polygons to receive and reflect the rays\n",
      "of the meridian sun; and a consuming flame was darted, to the distance,\n",
      "perhaps of two hundred feet. The truth of these two extraordinary facts\n",
      "is invalidated by the silence of the most authentic historians; and the\n",
      "use of burning-glasses was never adopted in the attack or defence of\n",
      "places. Yet the admirable experiments of a French philosopher have\n",
      "demonstrated the possibility of such a mirror; and, since it is\n",
      "possible, I am more disposed to attribute the art to the greatest\n",
      "mathematicians of antiquity, than to give the merit of the fiction\n",
      "to the idle fancy of a monk or a sophist. According to another story,\n",
      "Proclus applied sulphur to the destruction of the Gothic fleet; in a\n",
      "modern imagination, the name of sulphur is instantly connected with the\n",
      "suspicion of gunpowder, and that suspicion is propagated by the secret\n",
      "arts of his disciple Anthemius. A citizen of Tralles in Asia had five\n",
      "sons, who were all distinguished in their respective professions by\n",
      "merit and success. Olympius excelled in the knowledge and practice\n",
      "of the Roman jurisprudence. Dioscorus and Alexander became learned\n",
      "physicians; but the skill of the former was exercised for the benefit\n",
      "of his fellow-citizens, while his more ambitious brother acquired wealth\n",
      "and reputation at Rome. The fame of Metrodorus the grammarian, and\n",
      "of Anthemius the mathematician and architect, reached the ears of the\n",
      "emperor Justinian, who invited them to Constantinople; and while the one\n",
      "instructed the rising generation in the schools of eloquence, the other\n",
      "filled the capital and provinces with more lasting monuments of his\n",
      "art. In a trifling dispute relative to the walls or windows of their\n",
      "contiguous houses, he had been vanquished by the eloquence of his\n",
      "neighbor Zeno; but the orator was defeated in his turn by the master\n",
      "of mechanics, whose malicious, though harmless, stratagems are darkly\n",
      "represented by the ignorance of Agathias. In a lower room, Anthemius\n",
      "arranged several vessels or caldrons of water, each of them covered by\n",
      "the wide bottom of a leathern tube, which rose to a narrow top, and\n",
      "was artificially conveyed among the joists and rafters of the adjacent\n",
      "building. A fire was kindled beneath the caldron; the steam of the\n",
      "boiling water ascended through the tubes; the house was shaken by the\n",
      "efforts of imprisoned air, and its trembling inhabitants might wonder\n",
      "that the city was unconscious of the earthquake which they had felt. At\n",
      "another time, the friends of Zeno, as they sat at table, were dazzled\n",
      "by the intolerable light which flashed in their eyes from the reflecting\n",
      "mirrors of Anthemius; they were astonished by the noise which he\n",
      "produced from the collision of certain minute and sonorous particles;\n",
      "and the orator declared in tragic style to the senate, that a mere\n",
      "mortal must yield to the power of an antagonist, who shook the earth\n",
      "with the trident of Neptune, and imitated the thunder and lightning of\n",
      "Jove himself. The genius of Anthemius, and his colleague Isidore\n",
      "the Milesian, was excited and employed by a prince, whose taste for\n",
      "architecture had degenerated into a mischievous and costly passion.\n",
      "His favorite architects submitted their designs and difficulties to\n",
      "Justinian, and discreetly confessed how much their laborious meditations\n",
      "were surpassed by the intuitive knowledge of celestial inspiration of an\n",
      "emperor, whose views were always directed to the benefit of his people,\n",
      "the glory of his reign, and the salvation of his soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "The principal church, which was dedicated by the founder of\n",
      "Constantinople to St. Sophia, or the eternal wisdom, had been twice\n",
      "destroyed by fire; after the exile of John Chrysostom, and during the\n",
      "_Nika_ of the blue and green factions. No sooner did the tumult subside,\n",
      "than the Christian populace deplored their sacrilegious rashness; but\n",
      "they might have rejoiced in the calamity, had they foreseen the glory\n",
      "of the new temple, which at the end of forty days was strenuously\n",
      "undertaken by the piety of Justinian. The ruins were cleared away, a\n",
      "more spacious plan was described, and as it required the consent of some\n",
      "proprietors of ground, they obtained the most exorbitant terms from the\n",
      "eager desires and timorous conscience of the monarch. Anthemius formed\n",
      "the design, and his genius directed the hands of ten thousand workmen,\n",
      "whose payment in pieces of fine silver was never delayed beyond the\n",
      "evening. The emperor himself, clad in a linen tunic, surveyed each day\n",
      "their rapid progress, and encouraged their diligence by his familiarity,\n",
      "his zeal, and his rewards. The new Cathedral of St. Sophia was\n",
      "consecrated by the patriarch, five years, eleven months, and ten days\n",
      "from the first foundation; and in the midst of the solemn festival\n",
      "Justinian exclaimed with devout vanity, \"Glory be to God, who hath\n",
      "thought me worthy to accomplish so great a work; I have vanquished thee,\n",
      "O Solomon!\" But the pride of the Roman Solomon, before twenty years had\n",
      "elapsed, was humbled by an earthquake, which overthrew the eastern part\n",
      "of the dome. Its splendor was again restored by the perseverance of\n",
      "the same prince; and in the thirty-sixth year of his reign, Justinian\n",
      "celebrated the second dedication of a temple which remains, after twelve\n",
      "centuries, a stately monument of his fame. The architecture of St.\n",
      "Sophia, which is now converted into the principal mosch, has been\n",
      "imitated by the Turkish sultans, and that venerable pile continues\n",
      "to excite the fond admiration of the Greeks, and the more rational\n",
      "curiosity of European travellers. The eye of the spectator is\n",
      "disappointed by an irregular prospect of half-domes and shelving roofs:\n",
      "the western front, the principal approach, is destitute of simplicity\n",
      "and magnificence; and the scale of dimensions has been much surpassed by\n",
      "several of the Latin cathedrals. But the architect who first erected and\n",
      "_aerial_ cupola, is entitled to the praise of bold design and skilful\n",
      "execution. The dome of St. Sophia, illuminated by four-and-twenty\n",
      "windows, is formed with so small a curve, that the depth is equal\n",
      "only to one sixth of its diameter; the measure of that diameter is one\n",
      "hundred and fifteen feet, and the lofty centre, where a crescent has\n",
      "supplanted the cross, rises to the perpendicular height of one hundred\n",
      "and eighty feet above the pavement. The circle which encompasses the\n",
      "dome, lightly reposes on four strong arches, and their weight is firmly\n",
      "supported by four massy piles, whose strength is assisted, on the\n",
      "northern and southern sides, by four columns of Egyptian granite. A\n",
      "Greek cross, inscribed in a quadrangle, represents the form of the\n",
      "edifice; the exact breadth is two hundred and forty-three feet, and two\n",
      "hundred and sixty-nine may be assigned for the extreme length from the\n",
      "sanctuary in the east, to the nine western doors, which open into the\n",
      "vestibule, and from thence into the _narthex_ or exterior portico. That\n",
      "portico was the humble station of the penitents. The nave or body of the\n",
      "church was filled by the congregation of the faithful; but the two sexes\n",
      "were prudently distinguished, and the upper and lower galleries were\n",
      "allotted for the more private devotion of the women. Beyond the northern\n",
      "and southern piles, a balustrade, terminated on either side by the\n",
      "thrones of the emperor and the patriarch, divided the nave from the\n",
      "choir; and the space, as far as the steps of the altar, was occupied by\n",
      "the clergy and singers. The altar itself, a name which insensibly\n",
      "became familiar to Christian ears, was placed in the eastern recess,\n",
      "artificially built in the form of a demi-cylinder; and this sanctuary\n",
      "communicated by several doors with the sacristy, the vestry, the\n",
      "baptistery, and the contiguous buildings, subservient either to the\n",
      "pomp of worship, or the private use of the ecclesiastical ministers.\n",
      "The memory of past calamities inspired Justinian with a wise resolution,\n",
      "that no wood, except for the doors, should be admitted into the new\n",
      "edifice; and the choice of the materials was applied to the strength,\n",
      "the lightness, or the splendor of the respective parts. The solid piles\n",
      "which contained the cupola were composed of huge blocks of freestone,\n",
      "hewn into squares and triangles, fortified by circles of iron, and\n",
      "firmly cemented by the infusion of lead and quicklime: but the weight of\n",
      "the cupola was diminished by the levity of its substance, which consists\n",
      "either of pumice-stone that floats in the water, or of bricks from the\n",
      "Isle of Rhodes, five times less ponderous than the ordinary sort. The\n",
      "whole frame of the edifice was constructed of brick; but those base\n",
      "materials were concealed by a crust of marble; and the inside of St.\n",
      "Sophia, the cupola, the two larger, and the six smaller, semi-domes, the\n",
      "walls, the hundred columns, and the pavement, delight even the eyes of\n",
      "Barbarians, with a rich and variegated picture. A poet, who beheld the\n",
      "primitive lustre of St. Sophia, enumerates the colors, the shades,\n",
      "and the spots of ten or twelve marbles, jaspers, and porphyries, which\n",
      "nature had profusely diversified, and which were blended and contrasted\n",
      "as it were by a skilful painter. The triumph of Christ was adorned with\n",
      "the last spoils of Paganism, but the greater part of these costly stones\n",
      "was extracted from the quarries of Asia Minor, the isles and continent\n",
      "of Greece, Egypt, Africa, and Gaul. Eight columns of porphyry, which\n",
      "Aurelian had placed in the temple of the sun, were offered by the piety\n",
      "of a Roman matron; eight others of green marble were presented by the\n",
      "ambitious zeal of the magistrates of Ephesus: both are admirable by\n",
      "their size and beauty, but every order of architecture disclaims their\n",
      "fantastic capital. A variety of ornaments and figures was curiously\n",
      "expressed in mosaic; and the images of Christ, of the Virgin, of saints,\n",
      "and of angels, which have been defaced by Turkish fanaticism, were\n",
      "dangerously exposed to the superstition of the Greeks. According to the\n",
      "sanctity of each object, the precious metals were distributed in thin\n",
      "leaves or in solid masses. The balustrade of the choir, the capitals\n",
      "of the pillars, the ornaments of the doors and galleries, were of\n",
      "gilt bronze; the spectator was dazzled by the glittering aspect of the\n",
      "cupola; the sanctuary contained forty thousand pounds weight of silver;\n",
      "and the holy vases and vestments of the altar were of the purest gold,\n",
      "enriched with inestimable gems. Before the structure of the church had\n",
      "arisen two cubits above the ground, forty-five thousand two hundred\n",
      "pounds were already consumed; and the whole expense amounted to three\n",
      "hundred and twenty thousand: each reader, according to the measure of\n",
      "his belief, may estimate their value either in gold or silver; but the\n",
      "sum of one million sterling is the result of the lowest computation.\n",
      "A magnificent temple is a laudable monument of national taste and\n",
      "religion; and the enthusiast who entered the dome of St. Sophia might be\n",
      "tempted to suppose that it was the residence, or even the workmanship,\n",
      "of the Deity. Yet how dull is the artifice, how insignificant is the\n",
      "labor, if it be compared with the formation of the vilest insect that\n",
      "crawls upon the surface of the temple!\n",
      "\n",
      "So minute a description of an edifice which time has respected, may\n",
      "attest the truth, and excuse the relation, of the innumerable works,\n",
      "both in the capital and provinces, which Justinian constructed on a\n",
      "smaller scale and less durable foundations. In Constantinople alone and\n",
      "the adjacent suburbs, he dedicated twenty-five churches to the honor\n",
      "of Christ, the Virgin, and the saints: most of these churches were\n",
      "decorated with marble and gold; and their various situation was\n",
      "skilfully chosen in a populous square, or a pleasant grove; on the\n",
      "margin of the sea-shore, or on some lofty eminence which overlooked\n",
      "the continents of Europe and Asia. The church of the Holy Apostles at\n",
      "Constantinople, and that of St. John at Ephesus, appear to have been\n",
      "framed on the same model: their domes aspired to imitate the cupolas of\n",
      "St. Sophia; but the altar was more judiciously placed under the centre\n",
      "of the dome, at the junction of four stately porticos, which more\n",
      "accurately expressed the figure of the Greek cross. The Virgin of\n",
      "Jerusalem might exult in the temple erected by her Imperial votary on a\n",
      "most ungrateful spot, which afforded neither ground nor materials to the\n",
      "architect. A level was formed by raising part of a deep valley to the\n",
      "height of the mountain. The stones of a neighboring quarry were hewn\n",
      "into regular forms; each block was fixed on a peculiar carriage, drawn\n",
      "by forty of the strongest oxen, and the roads were widened for the\n",
      "passage of such enormous weights. Lebanon furnished her loftiest cedars\n",
      "for the timbers of the church; and the seasonable discovery of a vein of\n",
      "red marble supplied its beautiful columns, two of which, the supporters\n",
      "of the exterior portico, were esteemed the largest in the world. The\n",
      "pious munificence of the emperor was diffused over the Holy Land; and if\n",
      "reason should condemn the monasteries of both sexes which were built or\n",
      "restored by Justinian, yet charity must applaud the wells which he\n",
      "sunk, and the hospitals which he founded, for the relief of the weary\n",
      "pilgrims. The schismatical temper of Egypt was ill entitled to the\n",
      "royal bounty; but in Syria and Africa, some remedies were applied to\n",
      "the disasters of wars and earthquakes, and both Carthage and Antioch,\n",
      "emerging from their ruins, might revere the name of their gracious\n",
      "benefactor. Almost every saint in the calendar acquired the honors of a\n",
      "temple; almost every city of the empire obtained the solid advantages\n",
      "of bridges, hospitals, and aqueducts; but the severe liberality of the\n",
      "monarch disdained to indulge his subjects in the popular luxury of baths\n",
      "and theatres. While Justinian labored for the public service, he was not\n",
      "unmindful of his own dignity and ease. The Byzantine palace, which had\n",
      "been damaged by the conflagration, was restored with new magnificence;\n",
      "and some notion may be conceived of the whole edifice, by the vestibule\n",
      "or hall, which, from the doors perhaps, or the roof, was surnamed\n",
      "_chalce_, or the brazen. The dome of a spacious quadrangle was\n",
      "supported by massy pillars; the pavement and walls were incrusted with\n",
      "many-colored marbles--the emerald green of Laconia, the fiery red, and\n",
      "the white Phrygian stone, intersected with veins of a sea-green hue: the\n",
      "mosaic paintings of the dome and sides represented the glories of the\n",
      "African and Italian triumphs. On the Asiatic shore of the Propontis, at\n",
      "a small distance to the east of Chalcedon, the costly palace and gardens\n",
      "of HerÊum were prepared for the summer residence of Justinian, and more\n",
      "especially of Theodora. The poets of the age have celebrated the rare\n",
      "alliance of nature and art, the harmony of the nymphs of the groves, the\n",
      "fountains, and the waves: yet the crowd of attendants who followed the\n",
      "court complained of their inconvenient lodgings, and the nymphs were too\n",
      "often alarmed by the famous Porphyrio, a whale of ten cubits in breadth,\n",
      "and thirty in length, who was stranded at the mouth of the River\n",
      "Sangaris, after he had infested more than half a century the seas of\n",
      "Constantinople.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fortifications of Europe and Asia were multiplied by Justinian; but\n",
      "the repetition of those timid and fruitless precautions exposes, to\n",
      "a philosophic eye, the debility of the empire. From Belgrade to the\n",
      "Euxine, from the conflux of the Save to the mouth of the Danube, a chain\n",
      "of above fourscore fortified places was extended along the banks of the\n",
      "great river. Single watch-towers were changed into spacious citadels;\n",
      "vacant walls, which the engineers contracted or enlarged according to\n",
      "the nature of the ground, were filled with colonies or garrisons; a\n",
      "strong fortress defended the ruins of Trajan's bridge, and several\n",
      "military stations affected to spread beyond the Danube the pride of the\n",
      "Roman name. But that name was divested of its terrors; the Barbarians,\n",
      "in their annual inroads, passed, and contemptuously repassed, before\n",
      "these useless bulwarks; and the inhabitants of the frontier, instead\n",
      "of reposing under the shadow of the general defence, were compelled\n",
      "to guard, with incessant vigilance, their separate habitations. The\n",
      "solitude of ancient cities, was replenished; the new foundations of\n",
      "Justinian acquired, perhaps too hastily, the epithets of impregnable\n",
      "and populous; and the auspicious place of his own nativity attracted\n",
      "the grateful reverence of the vainest of princes. Under the name of\n",
      "_Justiniana prima_, the obscure village of Tauresium became the seat\n",
      "of an archbishop and a prÊfect, whose jurisdiction extended over\n",
      "seven warlike provinces of Illyricum; and the corrupt apellation of\n",
      "_Giustendil_ still indicates, about twenty miles to the south of\n",
      "Sophia, the residence of a Turkish sanjak. For the use of the emperor's\n",
      "countryman, a cathedral, a place, and an aqueduct, were speedily\n",
      "constructed; the public and private edifices were adapted to the\n",
      "greatness of a royal city; and the strength of the walls resisted,\n",
      "during the lifetime of Justinian, the unskilful assaults of the Huns and\n",
      "Sclavonians. Their progress was sometimes retarded, and their hopes\n",
      "of rapine were disappointed, by the innumerable castles which, in the\n",
      "provinces of Dacia, Epirus, Thessaly, Macedonia, and Thrace, appeared\n",
      "to cover the whole face of the country. Six hundred of these forts were\n",
      "built or repaired by the emperor; but it seems reasonable to believe,\n",
      "that the far greater part consisted only of a stone or brick tower, in\n",
      "the midst of a square or circular area, which was surrounded by a wall\n",
      "and ditch, and afforded in a moment of danger some protection to the\n",
      "peasants and cattle of the neighboring villages. Yet these military\n",
      "works, which exhausted the public treasure, could not remove the just\n",
      "apprehensions of Justinian and his European subjects. The warm baths of\n",
      "Anchialus in Thrace were rendered as safe as they were salutary; but the\n",
      "rich pastures of Thessalonica were foraged by the Scythian cavalry;\n",
      "the delicious vale of Tempe, three hundred miles from the Danube,\n",
      "was continually alarmed by the sound of war; and no unfortified spot,\n",
      "however distant or solitary, could securely enjoy the blessings of\n",
      "peace. The Straits of ThermopylÊ, which seemed to protect, but which had\n",
      "so often betrayed, the safety of Greece, were diligently strengthened\n",
      "by the labors of Justinian. From the edge of the sea-shore, through\n",
      "the forests and valleys, and as far as the summit of the Thessalian\n",
      "mountains, a strong wall was continued, which occupied every practicable\n",
      "entrance. Instead of a hasty crowd of peasants, a garrison of two\n",
      "thousand soldiers was stationed along the rampart; granaries of corn\n",
      "and reservoirs of water were provided for their use; and by a precaution\n",
      "that inspired the cowardice which it foresaw, convenient fortresses\n",
      "were erected for their retreat. The walls of Corinth, overthrown by\n",
      "an earthquake, and the mouldering bulwarks of Athens and PlatÊa, were\n",
      "carefully restored; the Barbarians were discouraged by the prospect of\n",
      "successive and painful sieges: and the naked cities of Peloponnesus\n",
      "were covered by the fortifications of the Isthmus of Corinth. At the\n",
      "extremity of Europe, another peninsula, the Thracian Chersonesus, runs\n",
      "three days' journey into the sea, to form, with the adjacent shores\n",
      "of Asia, the Straits of the Hellespont. The intervals between eleven\n",
      "populous towns were filled by lofty woods, fair pastures, and arable\n",
      "lands; and the isthmus, of thirty seven stadia or furlongs, had been\n",
      "fortified by a Spartan general nine hundred years before the reign of\n",
      "Justinian. In an age of freedom and valor, the slightest rampart may\n",
      "prevent a surprise; and Procopius appears insensible of the superiority\n",
      "of ancient times, while he praises the solid construction and double\n",
      "parapet of a wall, whose long arms stretched on either side into\n",
      "the sea; but whose strength was deemed insufficient to guard the\n",
      "Chersonesus, if each city, and particularly Gallipoli and Sestus, had\n",
      "not been secured by their peculiar fortifications. The _long_ wall, as\n",
      "it was emphatically styled, was a work as disgraceful in the object,\n",
      "as it was respectable in the execution. The riches of a capital\n",
      "diffuse themselves over the neighboring country, and the territory of\n",
      "Constantinople a paradise of nature, was adorned with the luxurious\n",
      "gardens and villas of the senators and opulent citizens. But their\n",
      "wealth served only to attract the bold and rapacious Barbarians; the\n",
      "noblest of the Romans, in the bosom of peaceful indolence, were led away\n",
      "into Scythian captivity, and their sovereign might view from his palace\n",
      "the hostile flames which were insolently spread to the gates of the\n",
      "Imperial city. At the distance only of forty miles, Anastasius was\n",
      "constrained to establish a last frontier; his long wall, of sixty miles\n",
      "from the Propontis to the Euxine, proclaimed the impotence of his arms;\n",
      "and as the danger became more imminent, new fortifications were added by\n",
      "the indefatigable prudence of Justinian.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asia Minor, after the submission of the Isaurians, remained without\n",
      "enemies and without fortifications. Those bold savages, who had\n",
      "disdained to be the subjects of Gallienus, persisted two hundred and\n",
      "thirty years in a life of independence and rapine. The most successful\n",
      "princes respected the strength of the mountains and the despair of\n",
      "the natives; their fierce spirit was sometimes soothed with gifts,\n",
      "and sometimes restrained by terror; and a military count, with three\n",
      "legions, fixed his permanent and ignominious station in the heart of\n",
      "the Roman provinces. But no sooner was the vigilance of power relaxed or\n",
      "diverted, than the light-armed squadrons descended from the hills, and\n",
      "invaded the peaceful plenty of Asia. Although the Isaurians were\n",
      "not remarkable for stature or bravery, want rendered them bold, and\n",
      "experience made them skilful in the exercise of predatory war.\n",
      "They advanced with secrecy and speed to the attack of villages and\n",
      "defenceless towns; their flying parties have sometimes touched the\n",
      "Hellespont, the Euxine, and the gates of Tarsus, Antioch, or Damascus;\n",
      "and the spoil was lodged in their inaccessible mountains, before the\n",
      "Roman troops had received their orders, or the distant province had\n",
      "computed its loss. The guilt of rebellion and robbery excluded them from\n",
      "the rights of national enemies; and the magistrates were instructed,\n",
      "by an edict, that the trial or punishment of an Isaurian, even on the\n",
      "festival of Easter, was a meritorious act of justice and piety. If the\n",
      "captives were condemned to domestic slavery, they maintained, with their\n",
      "sword or dagger, the private quarrel of their masters; and it was found\n",
      "expedient for the public tranquillity to prohibit the service of such\n",
      "dangerous retainers. When their countryman TarcalissÊus or Zeno ascended\n",
      "the throne, he invited a faithful and formidable band of Isaurians, who\n",
      "insulted the court and city, and were rewarded by an annual tribute of\n",
      "five thousand pounds of gold. But the hopes of fortune depopulated the\n",
      "mountains, luxury enervated the hardiness of their minds and bodies, and\n",
      "in proportion as they mixed with mankind, they became less qualified for\n",
      "the enjoyment of poor and solitary freedom. After the death of Zeno, his\n",
      "successor Anastasius suppressed their pensions, exposed their persons\n",
      "to the revenge of the people, banished them from Constantinople, and\n",
      "prepared to sustain a war, which left only the alternative of victory or\n",
      "servitude. A brother of the last emperor usurped the title of Augustus;\n",
      "his cause was powerfully supported by the arms, the treasures, and the\n",
      "magazines, collected by Zeno; and the native Isaurians must have formed\n",
      "the smallest portion of the hundred and fifty thousand Barbarians under\n",
      "his standard, which was sanctified, for the first time, by the presence\n",
      "of a fighting bishop. Their disorderly numbers were vanquished in the\n",
      "plains of Phrygia by the valor and discipline of the Goths; but a war\n",
      "of six years almost exhausted the courage of the emperor. The Isaurians\n",
      "retired to their mountains; their fortresses were successively besieged\n",
      "and ruined; their communication with the sea was intercepted; the\n",
      "bravest of their leaders died in arms; the surviving chiefs, before\n",
      "their execution, were dragged in chains through the hippodrome; a colony\n",
      "of their youth was transplanted into Thrace, and the remnant of the\n",
      "people submitted to the Roman government. Yet some generations elapsed\n",
      "before their minds were reduced to the level of slavery. The populous\n",
      "villages of Mount Taurus were filled with horsemen and archers: they\n",
      "resisted the imposition of tributes, but they recruited the armies of\n",
      "Justinian; and his civil magistrates, the proconsul of Cappadocia, the\n",
      "count of Isauria, and the prÊtors of Lycaonia and Pisidia, were invested\n",
      "with military power to restrain the licentious practice of rapes and\n",
      "assassinations.\n",

      "\n",
      "If we extend our view from the tropic to the mouth of the Tanais, we may\n",
      "observe, on one hand, the precautions of Justinian to curb the savages\n",
      "of ∆thiopia, and on the other, the long walls which he constructed\n",
      "in CrimÊa for the protection of his friendly Goths, a colony of three\n",
      "thousand shepherds and warriors. From that peninsula to Trebizond, the\n",
      "eastern curve of the Euxine was secured by forts, by alliance, or by\n",
      "religion; and the possession of _Lazica_, the Colchos of ancient, the\n",
      "Mingrelia of modern, geography, soon became the object of an important\n",
      "war. Trebizond, in after-times the seat of a romantic empire, was\n",
      "indebted to the liberality of Justinian for a church, an aqueduct, and\n",
      "a castle, whose ditches are hewn in the solid rock. From that maritime\n",
      "city, frontier line of five hundred miles may be drawn to the fortress\n",
      "of Circesium, the last Roman station on the Euphrates. Above Trebizond\n",
      "immediately, and five days' journey to the south, the country rises into\n",
      "dark forests and craggy mountains, as savage though not so lofty as the\n",
      "Alps and the Pyrenees. In this rigorous climate, where the snows seldom\n",
      "melt, the fruits are tardy and tasteless, even honey is poisonous: the\n",
      "most industrious tillage would be confined to some pleasant valleys; and\n",
      "the pastoral tribes obtained a scanty sustenance from the flesh and milk\n",
      "of their cattle. The _Chalybians_ derived their name and temper from\n",
      "the iron quality of the soil; and, since the days of Cyrus, they might\n",
      "produce, under the various appellations of ChadÊans and Zanians,\n",
      "an uninterrupted prescription of war and rapine. Under the reign of\n",
      "Justinian, they acknowledged the god and the emperor of the Romans, and\n",
      "seven fortresses were built in the most accessible passages, to exclude\n",
      "the ambition of the Persian monarch. The principal source of the\n",
      "Euphrates descends from the Chalybian mountains, and seems to flow\n",
      "towards the west and the Euxine: bending to the south-west, the river\n",
      "passes under the walls of Satala and Melitene, (which were restored\n",
      "by Justinian as the bulwarks of the Lesser Armenia,) and gradually\n",
      "approaches the Mediterranean Sea; till at length, repelled by Mount\n",
      "Taurus, the Euphrates inclines its long and flexible course to the\n",
      "south-east and the Gulf of Persia. Among the Roman cities beyond the\n",
      "Euphrates, we distinguish two recent foundations, which were named from\n",
      "Theodosius, and the relics of the martyrs; and two capitals, Amida and\n",
      "Edessa, which are celebrated in the history of every age. Their strength\n",
      "was proportioned by Justinian to the danger of their situation. A ditch\n",
      "and palisade might be sufficient to resist the artless force of the\n",
      "cavalry of Scythia; but more elaborate works were required to sustain\n",
      "a regular siege against the arms and treasures of the great king. His\n",
      "skilful engineers understood the methods of conducting deep mines, and\n",
      "of raising platforms to the level of the rampart: he shook the strongest\n",
      "battlements with his military engines, and sometimes advanced to the\n",
      "assault with a line of movable turrets on the backs of elephants. In\n",
      "the great cities of the East, the disadvantage of space, perhaps of\n",
      "position, was compensated by the zeal of the people, who seconded the\n",
      "garrison in the defence of their country and religion; and the fabulous\n",
      "promise of the Son of God, that Edessa should never be taken, filled the\n",
      "citizens with valiant confidence, and chilled the besiegers with doubt\n",
      "and dismay. The subordinate towns of Armenia and Mesopotamia were\n",
      "diligently strengthened, and the posts which appeared to have\n",
      "any command of ground or water were occupied by numerous forts,\n",
      "substantially built of stone, or more hastily erected with the obvious\n",
      "materials of earth and brick. The eye of Justinian investigated every\n",
      "spot; and his cruel precautions might attract the war into some lonely\n",
      "vale, whose peaceful natives, connected by trade and marriage, were\n",
      "ignorant of national discord and the quarrels of princes. Westward of\n",
      "the Euphrates, a sandy desert extends above six hundred miles to the Red\n",
      "Sea. Nature had interposed a vacant solitude between the ambition of two\n",
      "rival empires; the Arabians, till Mahomet arose, were formidable only as\n",
      "robbers; and in the proud security of peace the fortifications of Syria\n",
      "were neglected on the most vulnerable side.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the national enmity, at least the effects of that enmity, had\n",
      "been suspended by a truce, which continued above fourscore years. An\n",
      "ambassador from the emperor Zeno accompanied the rash and unfortunate\n",
      "Perozes, in his expedition against the Nepthalites, or white Huns,\n",
      "whose conquests had been stretched from the Caspian to the heart of\n",
      "India, whose throne was enriched with emeralds, and whose cavalry was\n",
      "supported by a line of two thousand elephants. The Persians were\n",
      "twice circumvented, in a situation which made valor useless and flight\n",
      "impossible; and the double victory of the Huns was achieved by military\n",
      "stratagem. They dismissed their royal captive after he had submitted to\n",
      "adore the majesty of a Barbarian; and the humiliation was poorly evaded\n",
      "by the casuistical subtlety of the Magi, who instructed Perozes to\n",
      "direct his attention to the rising sun. The indignant successor of\n",
      "Cyrus forgot his danger and his gratitude; he renewed the attack with\n",
      "headstrong fury, and lost both his army and his life. The death of\n",
      "Perozes abandoned Persia to her foreign and domestic enemies; and twelve\n",
      "years of confusion elapsed before his son Cabades, or Kobad, could\n",
      "embrace any designs of ambition or revenge. The unkind parsimony of\n",
      "Anastasius was the motive or pretence of a Roman war; the Huns and Arabs\n",
      "marched under the Persian standard, and the fortifications of Armenia\n",
      "and Mesopotamia were, at that time, in a ruinous or imperfect\n",
      "condition. The emperor returned his thanks to the governor and people\n",
      "of Martyropolis for the prompt surrender of a city which could not be\n",
      "successfully defended, and the conflagration of Theodosiopolis might\n",
      "justify the conduct of their prudent neighbors. Amida sustained a long\n",
      "and destructive siege: at the end of three months the loss of fifty\n",
      "thousand of the soldiers of Cabades was not balanced by any prospect\n",
      "of success, and it was in vain that the Magi deduced a flattering\n",
      "prediction from the indecency of the women on the ramparts, who had\n",
      "revealed their most secret charms to the eyes of the assailants. At\n",
      "length, in a silent night, they ascended the most accessible tower,\n",
      "which was guarded only by some monks, oppressed, after the duties of a\n",
      "festival, with sleep and wine. Scaling-ladders were applied at the dawn\n",
      "of day; the presence of Cabades, his stern command, and his drawn\n",
      "sword, compelled the Persians to vanquish; and before it was sheathed,\n",
      "fourscore thousand of the inhabitants had expiated the blood of their\n",
      "companions. After the siege of Amida, the war continued three years, and\n",
      "the unhappy frontier tasted the full measure of its calamities. The\n",
      "gold of Anastasius was offered too late, the number of his troops was\n",
      "defeated by the number of their generals; the country was stripped of\n",
      "its inhabitants, and both the living and the dead were abandoned to the\n",
      "wild beasts of the desert. The resistance of Edessa, and the deficiency\n",
      "of spoil, inclined the mind of Cabades to peace: he sold his conquests\n",
      "for an exorbitant price; and the same line, though marked with\n",
      "slaughter and devastation, still separated the two empires. To avert the\n",
      "repetition of the same evils, Anastasius resolved to found a new colony,\n",
      "so strong, that it should defy the power of the Persian, so far advanced\n",
      "towards Assyria, that its stationary troops might defend the province by\n",
      "the menace or operation of offensive war. For this purpose, the town\n",
      "of Dara, fourteen miles from Nisibis, and four days' journey from the\n",
      "Tigris, was peopled and adorned; the hasty works of Anastasius were\n",
      "improved by the perseverance of Justinian; and, without insisting on\n",
      "places less important, the fortifications of Dara may represent the\n",
      "military architecture of the age. The city was surrounded with two\n",
      "walls, and the interval between them, of fifty paces, afforded a retreat\n",
      "to the cattle of the besieged. The inner wall was a monument of strength\n",
      "and beauty: it measured sixty feet from the ground, and the height of\n",
      "the towers was one hundred feet; the loopholes, from whence an enemy\n",

      "soldiers were planted along the rampart, under the shelter of double\n",
      "galleries, and a third platform, spacious and secure, was raised on the\n",
      "summit of the towers. The exterior wall appears to have been less lofty,\n",
      "but more solid; and each tower was protected by a quadrangular bulwark.\n",
      "A hard, rocky soil resisted the tools of the miners, and on the\n",
      "south-east, where the ground was more tractable, their approach was\n",
      "retarded by a new work, which advanced in the shape of a half-moon. The\n",
      "double and treble ditches were filled with a stream of water; and in the\n",
      "management of the river, the most skilful labor was employed to supply\n",
      "the inhabitants, to distress the besiegers, and to prevent the mischiefs\n",
      "of a natural or artificial inundation. Dara continued more than sixty\n",
      "years to fulfil the wishes of its founders, and to provoke the jealousy\n",

      "have been frequently confounded in the geography both of the ancients\n",

      "applied to Derbend, which occupies a short declivity between the\n",
      "mountains and the sea: the city, if we give credit to local tradition,\n",
      "had been founded by the Greeks; and this dangerous entrance was\n",
      "fortified by the kings of Persia with a mole, double walls, and doors of\n",
      "iron. The _Iberian_ gates are formed by a narrow passage of six miles\n",
      "in Mount Caucasus, which opens from the northern side of Iberia, or\n",
      "Georgia, into the plain that reaches to the Tanais and the Volga. A\n",
      "fortress, designed by Alexander perhaps, or one of his successors,\n",
      "to command that important pass, had descended by right of conquest or\n",

      "price to the emperor; but while Anastasius paused, while he timorously\n",
      "computed the cost and the distance, a more vigilant rival interposed,\n",
      "and Cabades forcibly occupied the Straits of Caucasus. The Albanian and\n",
      "Iberian gates excluded the horsemen of Scythia from the shortest and\n",
      "most practicable roads, and the whole front of the mountains was covered\n",
      "by the rampart of Gog and Magog, the long wall which has excited the\n",
      "curiosity of an Arabian caliph and a Russian conqueror. According to a\n",
      "recent description, huge stones, seven feet thick, and twenty-one feet\n",
      "in length or height, are artificially joined without iron or cement, to\n",
      "compose a wall, which runs above three hundred miles from the shores\n",
      "of Derbend, over the hills, and through the valleys of Daghestan and\n",
      "Georgia. Without a vision, such a work might be undertaken by the policy\n",
      "of Cabades; without a miracle, it might be accomplished by his son, so\n",
      "formidable to the Romans, under the name of Chosroes; so dear to the\n",
      "Orientals, under the appellation of Nushirwan. The Persian monarch held\n",
      "in his hand the keys both of peace and war; but he stipulated, in every\n",
      "treaty, that Justinian should contribute to the expense of a common\n",

      "Athens, after her Persian triumphs, adopted the philosophy of Ionia\n",

      "city, whose inhabitants, about thirty thousand males, condensed, within\n",
      "the period of a single life, the genius of ages and millions. Our sense\n",
      "of the dignity of human nature is exalted by the simple recollection,\n",
      "that Isocrates was the companion of Plato and Xenophon; that he\n",
      "assisted, perhaps with the historian Thucydides, at the first\n",
      "representation of the dipus of Sophocles and the Iphigenia of Euripides;\n",
      "and that his pupils ∆schines and Demosthenes contended for the crown of\n",
      "patriotism in the presence of Aristotle, the master of Theophrastus, who\n",
      "taught at Athens with the founders of the Stoic and Epicurean sects.\n",
      "The ingenuous youth of Attica enjoyed the benefits of their domestic\n",
      "education, which was communicated without envy to the rival cities. Two\n",
      "thousand disciples heard the lessons of Theophrastus; the schools of\n",
      "rhetoric must have been still more populous than those of philosophy;\n",
      "and a rapid succession of students diffused the fame of their teachers\n",
      "as far as the utmost limits of the Grecian language and name. Those\n",
      "limits were enlarged by the victories of Alexander; the arts of Athens\n",
      "survived her freedom and dominion; and the Greek colonies which the\n",
      "Macedonians planted in Egypt, and scattered over Asia, undertook long\n",
      "and frequent pilgrimages to worship the Muses in their favorite temple\n",
      "on the banks of the Ilissus. The Latin conquerors respectfully listened\n",
      "to the instructions of their subjects and captives; the names of Cicero\n",
      "and Horace were enrolled in the schools of Athens; and after the perfect\n",
      "settlement of the Roman empire, the natives of Italy, of Africa, and\n",
      "of Britain, conversed in the groves of the academy with their\n",
      "fellow-students of the East. The studies of philosophy and eloquence are\n",
      "congenial to a popular state, which encourages the freedom of inquiry,\n",
      "and submits only to the force of persuasion. In the republics of Greece\n",
      "and Rome, the art of speaking was the powerful engine of patriotism or\n",
      "ambition; and the schools of rhetoric poured forth a colony of statesmen\n",
      "and legislators. When the liberty of public debate was suppressed, the\n",
      "orator, in the honorable profession of an advocate, might plead the\n",
      "cause of innocence and justice; he might abuse his talents in the\n",
      "more profitable trade of panegyric; and the same precepts continued\n",
      "to dictate the fanciful declamations of the sophist, and the chaster\n",
      "beauties of historical composition. The systems which professed to\n",
      "unfold the nature of God, of man, and of the universe, entertained the\n",
      "curiosity of the philosophic student; and according to the temper of\n",
      "his mind, he might doubt with the Sceptics, or decide with the Stoics,\n",
      "sublimely speculate with Plato, or severely argue with Aristotle. The\n",
      "pride of the adverse sects had fixed an unattainable term of moral\n",
      "happiness and perfection; but the race was glorious and salutary; the\n",
      "disciples of Zeno, and even those of Epicurus, were taught both to act\n",
      "and to suffer; and the death of Petronius was not less effectual than\n",
      "that of Seneca, to humble a tyrant by the discovery of his impotence.\n",
      "The light of science could not indeed be confined within the walls of\n",
      "Athens. Her incomparable writers address themselves to the human race;\n",
      "the living masters emigrated to Italy and Asia; Berytus, in later\n",
      "times, was devoted to the study of the law; astronomy and physic\n",
      "were cultivated in the musÊum of Alexandria; but the Attic schools of\n",
      "rhetoric and philosophy maintained their superior reputation from the\n",
      "Peloponnesian war to the reign of Justinian. Athens, though situate in a\n",
      "barren soil, possessed a pure air, a free navigation, and the monuments\n",
      "of ancient art. That sacred retirement was seldom disturbed by the\n",
      "business of trade or government; and the last of the Athenians were\n",
      "distinguished by their lively wit, the purity of their taste and\n",
      "language, their social manners, and some traces, at least in discourse,\n",
      "of the magnanimity of their fathers. In the suburbs of the city, the\n",
      "_academy_ of the Platonists, the _lycum_ of the Peripatetics, the\n",
      "_portico_ of the Stoics, and the _garden_ of the Epicureans, were\n",
      "planted with trees and decorated with statues; and the philosophers,\n",
      "instead of being immured in a cloister, delivered their instructions in\n",
      "spacious and pleasant walks, which, at different hours, were consecrated\n",
      "to the exercises of the mind and body. The genius of the founders\n",
      "still lived in those venerable seats; the ambition of succeeding to the\n",
      "masters of human reason excited a generous emulation; and the merit of\n",
      "the candidates was determined, on each vacancy, by the free voices of\n",
      "an enlightened people. The Athenian professors were paid by their\n",
      "disciples: according to their mutual wants and abilities, the price\n",
      "appears to have varied; and Isocrates himself, who derides the avarice\n",
      "of the sophists, required, in his school of rhetoric, about thirty\n",
      "pounds from each of his hundred pupils. The wages of industry are just\n",
      "and honorable, yet the same Isocrates shed tears at the first receipt\n",
      "of a stipend: the Stoic might blush when he was hired to preach the\n",
      "contempt of money; and I should be sorry to discover that Aristotle or\n",
      "Plato so far degenerated from the example of Socrates, as to exchange\n",
      "knowledge for gold. But some property of lands and houses was settled by\n",
      "the permission of the laws, and the legacies of deceased friends, on the\n",
      "philosophic chairs of Athens. Epicurus bequeathed to his disciples the\n",
      "gardens which he had purchased for eighty minÊ or two hundred and fifty\n",
      "pounds, with a fund sufficient for their frugal subsistence and monthly\n",
      "festivals; and the patrimony of Plato afforded an annual rent, which,\n",
      "in eight centuries, was gradually increased from three to one thousand\n",
      "pieces of gold. The schools of Athens were protected by the wisest and\n",
      "most virtuous of the Roman princes. The library, which Hadrian founded,\n",
      "was placed in a portico adorned with pictures, statues, and a roof of\n",
      "alabaster, and supported by one hundred columns of Phrygian marble. The\n",
      "public salaries were assigned by the generous spirit of the Antonines;\n",
      "and each professor of politics, of rhetoric, of the Platonic, the\n",
      "Peripatetic, the Stoic, and the Epicurean philosophy, received an annual\n",
      "stipend of ten thousand drachmÊ, or more than three hundred pounds\n",
      "sterling. After the death of Marcus, these liberal donations, and the\n",
      "privileges attached to the _thrones_ of science, were abolished and\n",
      "revived, diminished and enlarged; but some vestige of royal bounty may\n",
      "be found under the successors of Constantine; and their arbitrary choice\n",
      "of an unworthy candidate might tempt the philosophers of Athens to\n",
      "regret the days of independence and poverty. It is remarkable, that the\n",
      "impartial favor of the Antonines was bestowed on the four adverse sects\n",
      "of philosophy, which they considered as equally useful, or at least, as\n",
      "equally innocent. Socrates had formerly been the glory and the\n",
      "reproach of his country; and the first lessons of Epicurus so strangely\n",
      "scandalized the pious ears of the Athenians, that by his exile, and\n",
      "that of his antagonists, they silenced all vain disputes concerning\n",
      "the nature of the gods. But in the ensuing year they recalled the hasty\n",
      "decree, restored the liberty of the schools, and were convinced by the\n",
      "experience of ages, that the moral character of philosophers is not\n",
      "affected by the diversity of their theological speculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gothic arms were less fatal to the schools of Athens than the\n",
      "establishment of a new religion, whose ministers superseded the exercise\n",
      "of reason, resolved every question by an article of faith, and condemned\n",
      "the infidel or sceptic to eternal flames. In many a volume of laborious\n",
      "controversy, they exposed the weakness of the understanding and\n",
      "the corruption of the heart, insulted human nature in the sages of\n",
      "antiquity, and proscribed the spirit of philosophical inquiry, so\n",
      "repugnant to the doctrine, or at least to the temper, of an humble\n",
      "believer. The surviving sects of the Platonists, whom Plato would have\n",
      "blushed to acknowledge, extravagantly mingled a sublime theory with the\n",
      "practice of superstition and magic; and as they remained alone in the\n",
      "midst of a Christian world, they indulged a secret rancor against the\n",
      "government of the church and state, whose severity was still suspended\n",
      "over their heads. About a century after the reign of Julian, Proclus was\n",
      "permitted to teach in the philosophic chair of the academy; and such\n",
      "was his industry, that he frequently, in the same day, pronounced five\n",
      "lessons, and composed seven hundred lines. His sagacious mind explored\n",
      "the deepest questions of morals and metaphysics, and he ventured to urge\n",
      "eighteen arguments against the Christian doctrine of the creation of\n",
      "the world. But in the intervals of study, he _personally_ conversed\n",
      "with Pan, ∆sculapius, and Minerva, in whose mysteries he was secretly\n",
      "initiated, and whose prostrate statues he adored; in the devout\n",
      "persuasion that the philosopher, who is a citizen of the universe,\n",
      "should be the priest of its various deities. An eclipse of the sun\n",
      "announced his approaching end; and his life, with that of his scholar\n",
      "Isidore, compiled by two of their most learned disciples, exhibits a\n",
      "deplorable picture of the second childhood of human reason. Yet the\n",
      "golden chain, as it was fondly styled, of the Platonic succession,\n",
      "continued forty-four years from the death of Proclus to the edict of\n",
      "Justinian, which imposed a perpetual silence on the schools of Athens,\n",
      "and excited the grief and indignation of the few remaining votaries\n",
      "of Grecian science and superstition. Seven friends and philosophers,\n",
      "Diogenes and Hermias, Eulalius and Priscian, Damascius, Isidore, and\n",
      "Simplicius, who dissented from the religion of their sovereign, embraced\n",
      "the resolution of seeking in a foreign land the freedom which was denied\n",
      "in their native country. They had heard, and they credulously believed,\n",
      "that the republic of Plato was realized in the despotic government\n",
      "of Persia, and that a patriot king reigned ever the happiest and most\n",
      "virtuous of nations. They were soon astonished by the natural discovery,\n",
      "that Persia resembled the other countries of the globe; that Chosroes,\n",
      "who affected the name of a philosopher, was vain, cruel, and ambitious;\n",
      "that bigotry, and a spirit of intolerance, prevailed among the Magi;\n",
      "that the nobles were haughty, the courtiers servile, and the magistrates\n",
      "unjust; that the guilty sometimes escaped, and that the innocent were\n",
      "often oppressed. The disappointment of the philosophers provoked them\n",
      "to overlook the real virtues of the Persians; and they were scandalized,\n",
      "more deeply perhaps than became their profession, with the plurality\n",
      "of wives and concubines, the incestuous marriages, and the custom of\n",
      "exposing dead bodies to the dogs and vultures, instead of hiding them in\n",
      "the earth, or consuming them with fire. Their repentance was expressed\n",
      "by a precipitate return, and they loudly declared that they had rather\n",
      "die on the borders of the empire, than enjoy the wealth and favor of\n",
      "the Barbarian. From this journey, however, they derived a benefit which\n",
      "reflects the purest lustre on the character of Chosroes. He required,\n",
      "that the seven sages who had visited the court of Persia should be\n",
      "exempted from the penal laws which Justinian enacted against his Pagan\n",
      "subjects; and this privilege, expressly stipulated in a treaty of peace,\n",
      "was guarded by the vigilance of a powerful mediator. Simplicius and his\n",
      "companions ended their lives in peace and obscurity; and as they left no\n",
      "disciples, they terminate the long list of Grecian philosophers, who may\n",
      "be justly praised, notwithstanding their defects, as the wisest and most\n",
      "virtuous of their contemporaries. The writings of Simplicius are now\n",
      "extant. His physical and metaphysical commentaries on Aristotle have\n",
      "passed away with the fashion of the times; but his moral interpretation\n",
      "of Epictetus is preserved in the library of nations, as a classic book,\n",
      "most excellently adapted to direct the will, to purify the heart, and\n",
      "to confirm the understanding, by a just confidence in the nature both of\n",
      "God and man.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the same time that Pythagoras first invented the appellation of\n",
      "philosopher, liberty and the consulship were founded at Rome by the\n",
      "elder Brutus. The revolutions of the consular office, which may be\n",
      "viewed in the successive lights of a substance, a shadow, and a name,\n",
      "have been occasionally mentioned in the present History. The first\n",
      "magistrates of the republic had been chosen by the people, to exercise,\n",
      "in the senate and in the camp, the powers of peace and war, which were\n",
      "afterwards translated to the emperors. But the tradition of ancient\n",
      "dignity was long revered by the Romans and Barbarians. A Gothic\n",
      "historian applauds the consulship of Theodoric as the height of all\n",
      "temporal glory and greatness; the king of Italy himself congratulated\n",
      "those annual favorites of fortune who, without the cares, enjoyed the\n",
      "splendor of the throne; and at the end of a thousand years, two consuls\n",
      "were created by the sovereigns of Rome and Constantinople, for the sole\n",
      "purpose of giving a date to the year, and a festival to the people. But\n",
      "the expenses of this festival, in which the wealthy and the vain aspired\n",
      "to surpass their predecessors, insensibly arose to the enormous sum of\n",
      "fourscore thousand pounds; the wisest senators declined a useless\n",
      "honor, which involved the certain ruin of their families, and to this\n",
      "reluctance I should impute the frequent chasms in the last age of the\n",
      "consular Fasti. The predecessors of Justinian had assisted from the\n",
      "public treasures the dignity of the less opulent candidates; the avarice\n",
      "of that prince preferred the cheaper and more convenient method of\n",
      "advice and regulation. Seven _processions_ or spectacles were the number\n",
      "to which his edict confined the horse and chariot races, the athletic\n",
      "sports, the music, and pantomimes of the theatre, and the hunting of\n",
      "wild beasts; and small pieces of silver were discreetly substituted to\n",
      "the gold medals, which had always excited tumult and drunkenness,\n",
      "when they were scattered with a profuse hand among the populace.\n",
      "Notwithstanding these precautions, and his own example, the succession\n",
      "of consuls finally ceased in the thirteenth year of Justinian, whose\n",
      "despotic temper might be gratified by the silent extinction of a title\n",
      "which admonished the Romans of their ancient freedom. Yet the annual\n",
      "consulship still lived in the minds of the people; they fondly expected\n",
      "its speedy restoration; they applauded the gracious condescension of\n",
      "successive princes, by whom it was assumed in the first year of their\n",
      "reign; and three centuries elapsed, after the death of Justinian, before\n",
      "that obsolete dignity, which had been suppressed by custom, could be\n",

      "When Justinian ascended the throne, about fifty years after the fall of\n",
      "the Western empire, the kingdoms of the Goths and Vandals had obtained\n",
      "a solid, and, as it might seem, a legal establishment both in Europe and\n",
      "Africa. The titles, which Roman victory had inscribed, were erased\n",
      "with equal justice by the sword of the Barbarians; and their successful\n",
      "rapine derived a more venerable sanction from time, from treaties,\n",
      "and from the oaths of fidelity, already repeated by a second or third\n",
      "generation of obedient subjects. Experience and Christianity had refuted\n",
      "the superstitious hope, that Rome was founded by the gods to reign\n",
      "forever over the nations of the earth. But the proud claim of perpetual\n",
      "and indefeasible dominion, which her soldiers could no longer maintain,\n",
      "was firmly asserted by her statesmen and lawyers, whose opinions\n",
      "have been sometimes revived and propagated in the modern schools of\n",
      "jurisprudence. After Rome herself had been stripped of the Imperial\n",
      "purple, the princes of Constantinople assumed the sole and sacred\n",
      "sceptre of the monarchy; demanded, as their rightful inheritance, the\n",
      "provinces which had been subdued by the consuls, or possessed by the\n",
      "CÊsars; and feebly aspired to deliver their faithful subjects of the\n",
      "West from the usurpation of heretics and Barbarians. The execution of\n",
      "this splendid design was in some degree reserved for Justinian. During\n",
      "the five first years of his reign, he reluctantly waged a costly and\n",
      "unprofitable war against the Persians; till his pride submitted to\n",
      "his ambition, and he purchased at the price of four hundred and forty\n",
      "thousand pounds sterling, the benefit of a precarious truce, which, in\n",
      "the language of both nations, was dignified with the appellation of the\n",
      "_endless_ peace. The safety of the East enabled the emperor to employ\n",
      "his forces against the Vandals; and the internal state of Africa\n",
      "afforded an honorable motive, and promised a powerful support, to the\n",

      "According to the testament of the founder, the African kingdom had\n",
      "lineally descended to Hilderic, the eldest of the Vandal princes. A mild\n",
      "disposition inclined the son of a tyrant, the grandson of a conqueror,\n",
      "to prefer the counsels of clemency and peace; and his accession was\n",
      "marked by the salutary edict, which restored two hundred bishops to\n",
      "their churches, and allowed the free profession of the Athanasian creed.\n",
      "But the Catholics accepted, with cold and transient gratitude, a favor\n",
      "so inadequate to their pretensions, and the virtues of Hilderic offended\n",
      "the prejudices of his countrymen. The Arian clergy presumed to insinuate\n",
      "that he had renounced the faith, and the soldiers more loudly complained\n",
      "that he had degenerated from the courage, of his ancestors. His\n",
      "ambassadors were suspected of a secret and disgraceful negotiation in\n",
      "the Byzantine court; and his general, the Achilles, as he was named, of\n",
      "the Vandals, lost a battle against the naked and disorderly Moors. The\n",
      "public discontent was exasperated by Gelimer, whose age, descent, and\n",
      "military fame, gave him an apparent title to the succession: he assumed,\n",
      "with the consent of the nation, the reins of government; and his\n",
      "unfortunate sovereign sunk without a struggle from the throne to a\n",
      "dungeon, where he was strictly guarded with a faithful counsellor, and\n",
      "his unpopular nephew the Achilles of the Vandals. But the indulgence\n",
      "which Hilderic had shown to his Catholic subjects had powerfully\n",
      "recommended him to the favor of Justinian, who, for the benefit of his\n",
      "own sect, could acknowledge the use and justice of religious toleration:\n",
      "their alliance, while the nephew of Justin remained in a private\n",
      "station, was cemented by the mutual exchange of gifts and letters; and\n",
      "the emperor Justinian asserted the cause of royalty and friendship. In\n",
      "two successive embassies, he admonished the usurper to repent of his\n",
      "treason, or to abstain, at least, from any further violence which might\n",
      "provoke the displeasure of God and of the Romans; to reverence the laws\n",
      "of kindred and succession, and to suffer an infirm old man peaceably\n",
      "to end his days, either on the throne of Carthage or in the palace of\n",
      "Constantinople. The passions, or even the prudence, of Gelimer compelled\n",
      "him to reject these requests, which were urged in the haughty tone of\n",
      "menace and command; and he justified his ambition in a language rarely\n",
      "spoken in the Byzantine court, by alleging the right of a free people to\n",
      "remove or punish their chief magistrate, who had failed in the execution\n",
      "of the kingly office. After this fruitless expostulation, the captive\n",
      "monarch was more rigorously treated, his nephew was deprived of his\n",
      "eyes, and the cruel Vandal, confident in his strength and distance,\n",
      "derided the vain threats and slow preparations of the emperor of the\n",
      "East. Justinian resolved to deliver or revenge his friend, Gelimer to\n",
      "maintain his usurpation; and the war was preceded, according to the\n",
      "practice of civilized nations, by the most solemn protestations, that\n",
      "each party was sincerely desirous of peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report of an African war was grateful only to the vain and idle\n",
      "populace of Constantinople, whose poverty exempted them from tribute,\n",
      "and whose cowardice was seldom exposed to military service. But the\n",
      "wiser citizens, who judged of the future by the past, revolved in their\n",
      "memory the immense loss, both of men and money, which the empire had\n",
      "sustained in the expedition of Basiliscus. The troops, which, after\n",
      "five laborious campaigns, had been recalled from the Persian frontier,\n",
      "dreaded the sea, the climate, and the arms of an unknown enemy. The\n",
      "ministers of the finances computed, as far as they might compute, the\n",
      "demands of an African war; the taxes which must be found and levied to\n",
      "supply those insatiate demands; and the danger, lest their own lives, or\n",
      "at least their lucrative employments, should be made responsible for the\n",
      "deficiency of the supply. Inspired by such selfish motives, (for we may\n",
      "not suspect him of any zeal for the public good,) John of Cappadocia\n",
      "ventured to oppose in full council the inclinations of his master. He\n",
      "confessed, that a victory of such importance could not be too dearly\n",
      "purchased; but he represented in a grave discourse the certain\n",
      "difficulties and the uncertain event. \"You undertake,\" said the prÊfect,\n",
      "\"to besiege Carthage: by land, the distance is not less than one hundred\n",
      "and forty days' journey; on the sea, a whole year must elapse before\n",
      "you can receive any intelligence from your fleet. If Africa should\n",
      "be reduced, it cannot be preserved without the additional conquest of\n",
      "Sicily and Italy. Success will impose the obligations of new labors;\n",
      "a single misfortune will attract the Barbarians into the heart of your\n",
      "exhausted empire.\" Justinian felt the weight of this salutary advice; he\n",
      "was confounded by the unwonted freedom of an obsequious servant; and the\n",
      "design of the war would perhaps have been relinquished, if his courage\n",
      "had not been revived by a voice which silenced the doubts of profane\n",
      "reason. \"I have seen a vision,\" cried an artful or fanatic bishop of the\n",
      "East. \"It is the will of Heaven, O emperor! that you should not abandon\n",
      "your holy enterprise for the deliverance of the African church. The God\n",
      "of battles will march before your standard, and disperse your enemies,\n",
      "who are the enemies of his Son.\" The emperor, might be tempted, and\n",
      "his counsellors were constrained, to give credit to this seasonable\n",
      "revelation: but they derived more rational hope from the revolt, which\n",
      "the adherents of Hilderic or Athanasius had already excited on the\n",
      "borders of the Vandal monarchy. Pudentius, an African subject, had\n",
      "privately signified his loyal intentions, and a small military aid\n",
      "restored the province of Tripoli to the obedience of the Romans. The\n",
      "government of Sardinia had been intrusted to Godas, a valiant Barbarian\n",
      "he suspended the payment of tribute, disclaimed his allegiance to the\n",
      "usurper, and gave audience to the emissaries of Justinian, who found him\n",
      "master of that fruitful island, at the head of his guards, and proudly\n",
      "invested with the ensigns of royalty. The forces of the Vandals were\n",
      "diminished by discord and suspicion; the Roman armies were animated by\n",
      "the spirit of Belisarius; one of those heroic names which are familiar\n",
      "to every age and to every nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Africanus of new Rome was born, and perhaps educated, among the\n",
      "Thracian peasants, without any of those advantages which had formed\n",
      "the virtues of the elder and younger Scipio; a noble origin, liberal\n",
      "studies, and the emulation of a free state. The silence of a loquacious\n",
      "secretary may be admitted, to prove that the youth of Belisarius could\n",
      "not afford any subject of praise: he served, most assuredly with valor\n",
      "and reputation, among the private guards of Justinian; and when his\n",
      "patron became emperor, the domestic was promoted to military command.\n",
      "After a bold inroad into Persarmenia, in which his glory was shared by a\n",
      "colleague, and his progress was checked by an enemy, Belisarius repaired\n",
      "to the important station of Dara, where he first accepted the service\n",
      "of Procopius, the faithful companion, and diligent historian, of his\n",
      "exploits. The Mirranes of Persia advanced, with forty thousand of her\n",
      "best troops, to raze the fortifications of Dara; and signified the\n",
      "day and the hour on which the citizens should prepare a bath for his\n",
      "refreshment, after the toils of victory. He encountered an adversary\n",
      "equal to himself, by the new title of General of the East; his superior\n",
      "in the science of war, but much inferior in the number and quality\n",
      "of his troops, which amounted only to twenty-five thousand Romans and\n",
      "strangers, relaxed in their discipline, and humbled by recent disasters.\n",
      "As the level plain of Dara refused all shelter to stratagem and ambush,\n",
      "Belisarius protected his front with a deep trench, which was prolonged\n",
      "at first in perpendicular, and afterwards in parallel, lines, to cover\n",
      "the wings of cavalry advantageously posted to command the flanks and\n",
      "rear of the enemy. When the Roman centre was shaken, their well-timed\n",
      "and rapid charge decided the conflict: the standard of Persia fell;\n",
      "the _immortals_ fled; the infantry threw away their bucklers, and eight\n",
      "thousand of the vanquished were left on the field of battle. In the next\n",
      "campaign, Syria was invaded on the side of the desert; and Belisarius,\n",
      "with twenty thousand men, hastened from Dara to the relief of the\n",
      "province. During the whole summer, the designs of the enemy were baffled\n",
      "by his skilful dispositions: he pressed their retreat, occupied\n",
      "each night their camp of the preceding day, and would have secured a\n",
      "bloodless victory, if he could have resisted the impatience of his\n",
      "own troops. Their valiant promise was faintly supported in the hour\n",
      "of battle; the right wing was exposed by the treacherous or cowardly\n",
      "desertion of the Christian Arabs; the Huns, a veteran band of eight\n",
      "hundred warriors, were oppressed by superior numbers; the flight of\n",
      "the Isaurians was intercepted; but the Roman infantry stood firm on the\n",
      "left; for Belisarius himself, dismounting from his horse, showed them\n",
      "that intrepid despair was their only safety. They turned their backs\n",
      "to the Euphrates, and their faces to the enemy: innumerable arrows\n",
      "glanced without effect from the compact and shelving order of their\n",
      "bucklers; an impenetrable line of pikes was opposed to the repeated\n",
      "assaults of the Persian cavalry; and after a resistance of many hours,\n",
      "the remaining troops were skilfully embarked under the shadow of the\n",
      "night. The Persian commander retired with disorder and disgrace, to\n",
      "answer a strict account of the lives of so many soldiers, which he had\n",
      "consumed in a barren victory. But the fame of Belisarius was not sullied\n",
      "by a defeat, in which he alone had saved his army from the consequences\n",
      "of their own rashness: the approach of peace relieved him from the\n",
      "guard of the eastern frontier, and his conduct in the sedition of\n",
      "Constantinople amply discharged his obligations to the emperor. When\n",
      "the African war became the topic of popular discourse and secret\n",
      "deliberation, each of the Roman generals was apprehensive, rather than\n",
      "ambitious, of the dangerous honor; but as soon as Justinian had declared\n",
      "his preference of superior merit, their envy was rekindled by the\n",
      "unanimous applause which was given to the choice of Belisarius. The\n",
      "temper of the Byzantine court may encourage a suspicion, that the hero\n",
      "was darkly assisted by the intrigues of his wife, the fair and subtle\n",
      "Antonina, who alternately enjoyed the confidence, and incurred the\n",
      "hatred, of the empress Theodora. The birth of Antonina was ignoble;\n",
      "she descended from a family of charioteers; and her chastity has\n",
      "been stained with the foulest reproach. Yet she reigned with long and\n",
      "absolute power over the mind of her illustrious husband; and if\n",
      "Antonina disdained the merit of conjugal fidelity, she expressed a manly\n",
      "friendship to Belisarius, whom she accompanied with undaunted resolution\n",
      "in all the hardships and dangers of a military life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preparations for the African war were not unworthy of the last\n",
      "contest between Rome and Carthage. The pride and flower of the army\n",
      "consisted of the guards of Belisarius, who, according to the pernicious\n",
      "indulgence of the times, devoted themselves, by a particular oath of\n",
      "fidelity, to the service of their patrons. Their strength and stature,\n",
      "for which they had been curiously selected, the goodness of their horses\n",
      "and armor, and the assiduous practice of all the exercises of war,\n",
      "enabled them to act whatever their courage might prompt; and their\n",
      "courage was exalted by the social honor of their rank, and the personal\n",
      "ambition of favor and fortune. Four hundred of the bravest of the\n",
      "Heruli marched under the banner of the faithful and active Pharas; their\n",
      "untractable valor was more highly prized than the tame submission of the\n",
      "Greeks and Syrians; and of such importance was it deemed to procure a\n",
      "reÎnforcement of six hundred MassagetÊ, or Huns, that they were allured\n",
      "by fraud and deceit to engage in a naval expedition. Five thousand horse\n",
      "and ten thousand foot were embarked at Constantinople, for the conquest\n",
      "of Africa; but the infantry, for the most part levied in Thrace and\n",
      "Isauria, yielded to the more prevailing use and reputation of the\n",
      "cavalry; and the Scythian bow was the weapon on which the armies of Rome\n",
      "were now reduced to place their principal dependence. From a laudable\n",
      "desire to assert the dignity of his theme, Procopius defends the\n",
      "soldiers of his own time against the morose critics, who confined\n",
      "that respectable name to the heavy-armed warriors of antiquity, and\n",
      "maliciously observed, that the word archer is introduced by Homer as\n",
      "a term of contempt. \"Such contempt might perhaps be due to the naked\n",
      "youths who appeared on foot in the fields of Troy, and lurking behind\n",
      "a tombstone, or the shield of a friend, drew the bow-string to their\n",
      "breast, and dismissed a feeble and lifeless arrow. But our archers\n",
      "(pursues the historian) are mounted on horses, which they manage with\n",
      "admirable skill; their head and shoulders are protected by a casque or\n",
      "buckler; they wear greaves of iron on their legs, and their bodies are\n",
      "guarded by a coat of mail. On their right side hangs a quiver, a sword\n",
      "on their left, and their hand is accustomed to wield a lance or javelin\n",
      "in closer combat. Their bows are strong and weighty; they shoot in every\n",
      "possible direction, advancing, retreating, to the front, to the rear,\n",
      "or to either flank; and as they are taught to draw the bow-string not to\n",
      "the breast, but to the right ear, firm indeed must be the armor that\n",
      "can resist the rapid violence of their shaft.\" Five hundred transports,\n",
      "navigated by twenty thousand mariners of Egypt, Cilicia, and Ionia, were\n",
      "collected in the harbor of Constantinople. The smallest of these vessels\n",
      "may be computed at thirty, the largest at five hundred, tons; and the\n",
      "fair average will supply an allowance, liberal, but not profuse, of\n",
      "about one hundred thousand tons, for the reception of thirty-five\n",
      "thousand soldiers and sailors, of five thousand horses, of arms,\n",
      "engines, and military stores, and of a sufficient stock of water and\n",
      "provisions for a voyage, perhaps, of three months. The proud galleys,\n",
      "which in former ages swept the Mediterranean with so many hundred oars,\n",
      "had long since disappeared; and the fleet of Justinian was escorted only\n",
      "by ninety-two light brigantines, covered from the missile weapons of\n",
      "the enemy, and rowed by two thousand of the brave and robust youth\n",
      "of Constantinople. Twenty-two generals are named, most of whom were\n",
      "afterwards distinguished in the wars of Africa and Italy: but the\n",
      "supreme command, both by land and sea, was delegated to Belisarius\n",
      "alone, with a boundless power of acting according to his discretion,\n",
      "as if the emperor himself were present. The separation of the naval and\n",
      "military professions is at once the effect and the cause of the modern\n",
      "improvements in the science of navigation and maritime war.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the seventh year of the reign of Justinian, and about the time of\n",
      "the summer solstice, the whole fleet of six hundred ships was ranged in\n",
      "martial pomp before the gardens of the palace. The patriarch pronounced\n",
      "his benediction, the emperor signified his last commands, the general's\n",
      "trumpet gave the signal of departure, and every heart, according to\n",
      "its fears or wishes, explored, with anxious curiosity, the omens\n",
      "of misfortune and success. The first halt was made at Perinthus or\n",
      "Heraclea, where Belisarius waited five days to receive some Thracian\n",
      "horses, a military gift of his sovereign. From thence the fleet pursued\n",
      "their course through the midst of the Propontis; but as they struggled\n",
      "to pass the Straits of the Hellespont, an unfavorable wind detained them\n",
      "four days at Abydus, where the general exhibited a memorable lesson of\n",
      "firmness and severity. Two of the Huns, who in a drunken quarrel had\n",
      "slain one of their fellow-soldiers, were instantly shown to the army\n",
      "suspended on a lofty gibbet. The national dignity was resented by their\n",
      "countrymen, who disclaimed the servile laws of the empire, and asserted\n",
      "the free privilege of Scythia, where a small fine was allowed to expiate\n",
      "the hasty sallies of intemperance and anger. Their complaints were\n",
      "specious, their clamors were loud, and the Romans were not averse to the\n",
      "example of disorder and impunity. But the rising sedition was appeased\n",
      "by the authority and eloquence of the general: and he represented to\n",
      "the assembled troops the obligation of justice, the importance of\n",
      "discipline, the rewards of piety and virtue, and the unpardonable\n",
      "guilt of murder, which, in his apprehension, was aggravated rather\n",
      "than excused by the vice of intoxication. In the navigation from the\n",
      "Hellespont to Peloponnesus, which the Greeks, after the siege of Troy,\n",
      "had performed in four days, the fleet of Belisarius was guided in their\n",
      "course by his master-galley, conspicuous in the day by the redness of\n",
      "the sails, and in the night by the torches blazing from the mast head.\n",
      "It was the duty of the pilots, as they steered between the islands, and\n",
      "turned the Capes of Malea and TÊnarium, to preserve the just order and\n",
      "regular intervals of such a multitude of ships: as the wind was fair and\n",
      "moderate, their labors were not unsuccessful, and the troops were safely\n",
      "disembarked at Methone on the Messenian coast, to repose themselves for\n",
      "a while after the fatigues of the sea. In this place they experienced\n",
      "how avarice, invested with authority, may sport with the lives of\n",
      "thousands which are bravely exposed for the public service. According to\n",
      "military practice, the bread or biscuit of the Romans was twice prepared\n",
      "in the oven, and the diminution of one fourth was cheerfully allowed\n",
      "for the loss of weight. To gain this miserable profit, and to save the\n",
      "expense of wood, the prÊfect John of Cappadocia had given orders that\n",
      "the flour should be slightly baked by the same fire which warmed the\n",
      "baths of Constantinople; and when the sacks were opened, a soft and\n",
      "mouldy paste was distributed to the army. Such unwholesome food,\n",
      "assisted by the heat of the climate and season, soon produced an\n",
      "epidemical disease, which swept away five hundred soldiers. Their health\n",
      "was restored by the diligence of Belisarius, who provided fresh bread\n",
      "at Methone, and boldly expressed his just and humane indignation the\n",
      "emperor heard his complaint; the general was praised but the minister\n",
      "was not punished. From the port of Methone, the pilots steered along\n",
      "the western coast of Peloponnesus, as far as the Isle of Zacynthus, or\n",
      "Zante, before they undertook the voyage (in their eyes a most arduous\n",
      "voyage) of one hundred leagues over the Ionian Sea. As the fleet was\n",
      "surprised by a calm, sixteen days were consumed in the slow navigation;\n",
      "and even the general would have suffered the intolerable hardship of\n",
      "thirst, if the ingenuity of Antonina had not preserved the water in\n",
      "glass bottles, which she buried deep in the sand in a part of the ship\n",
      "impervious to the rays of the sun. At length the harbor of Caucana, on\n",
      "the southern side of Sicily, afforded a secure and hospitable shelter.\n",
      "The Gothic officers who governed the island in the name of the daughter\n",
      "and grandson of Theodoric, obeyed their imprudent orders, to receive the\n",
      "troops of Justinian like friends and allies: provisions were liberally\n",
      "supplied, the cavalry was remounted, and Procopius soon returned from\n",
      "Syracuse with correct information of the state and designs of\n",
      "the Vandals. His intelligence determined Belisarius to hasten his\n",
      "operations, and his wise impatience was seconded by the winds. The fleet\n",
      "lost sight of Sicily, passed before the Isle of Malta, discovered\n",
      "the capes of Africa, ran along the coast with a strong gale from the\n",
      "north-east, and finally cast anchor at the promontory of Caput Vada,\n",
      "about five days' journey to the south of Carthage.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Gelimer had been informed of the approach of the enemy, he must have\n",
      "delayed the conquest of Sardinia for the immediate defence of his person\n",
      "and kingdom. A detachment of five thousand soldiers, and one hundred and\n",
      "twenty galleys, would have joined the remaining forces of the Vandals;\n",
      "and the descendant of Genseric might have surprised and oppressed\n",
      "a fleet of deep laden transports, incapable of action, and of light\n",
      "brigantines that seemed only qualified for flight. Belisarius had\n",
      "secretly trembled when he overheard his soldiers, in the passage,\n",
      "emboldening each other to confess their apprehensions: if they were once\n",
      "on shore, they hoped to maintain the honor of their arms; but if they\n",
      "should be attacked at sea, they did not blush to acknowledge that they\n",
      "wanted courage to contend at the same time with the winds, the waves,\n",
      "and the Barbarians. The knowledge of their sentiments decided Belisarius\n",
      "to seize the first opportunity of landing them on the coast of Africa;\n",
      "and he prudently rejected, in a council of war, the proposal of sailing\n",
      "with the fleet and army into the port of Carthage. Three months after\n",
      "their departure from Constantinople, the men and horses, the arms and\n",
      "military stores, were safely disembarked, and five soldiers were left as\n",
      "a guard on board each of the ships, which were disposed in the form of\n",
      "a semicircle. The remainder of the troops occupied a camp on the\n",
      "sea-shore, which they fortified, according to ancient discipline, with\n",
      "a ditch and rampart; and the discovery of a source of fresh water, while\n",
      "it allayed the thirst, excited the superstitious confidence, of the\n",
      "Romans. The next morning, some of the neighboring gardens were pillaged;\n",
      "and Belisarius, after chastising the offenders, embraced the slight\n",
      "occasion, but the decisive moment, of inculcating the maxims of justice,\n",
      "moderation, and genuine policy. \"When I first accepted the commission\n",
      "of subduing Africa, I depended much less,\" said the general, \"on\n",
      "the numbers, or even the bravery of my troops, than on the friendly\n",
      "disposition of the natives, and their immortal hatred to the Vandals.\n",
      "You alone can deprive me of this hope; if you continue to extort by\n",
      "rapine what might be purchased for a little money, such acts of violence\n",
      "will reconcile these implacable enemies, and unite them in a just and\n",
      "holy league against the invaders of their country.\" These exhortations\n",
      "were enforced by a rigid discipline, of which the soldiers themselves\n",
      "soon felt and praised the salutary effects. The inhabitants, instead of\n",
      "deserting their houses, or hiding their corn, supplied the Romans with a\n",
      "fair and liberal market: the civil officers of the province continued to\n",
      "exercise their functions in the name of Justinian: and the clergy, from\n",
      "motives of conscience and interest, assiduously labored to promote\n",
      "the cause of a Catholic emperor. The small town of Sullecte, one day's\n",
      "journey from the camp, had the honor of being foremost to open her\n",
      "gates, and to resume her ancient allegiance: the larger cities of Leptis\n",
      "and Adrumetum imitated the example of loyalty as soon as Belisarius\n",
      "appeared; and he advanced without opposition as far as Grasse, a palace\n",
      "of the Vandal kings, at the distance of fifty miles from Carthage. The\n",
      "weary Romans indulged themselves in the refreshment of shady groves,\n",
      "cool fountains, and delicious fruits; and the preference which Procopius\n",
      "allows to these gardens over any that he had seen, either in the East\n",
      "or West, may be ascribed either to the taste, or the fatigue, or the\n",
      "historian. In three generations, prosperity and a warm climate had\n",
      "dissolved the hardy virtue of the Vandals, who insensibly became the\n",
      "most luxurious of mankind. In their villas and gardens, which might\n",
      "deserve the Persian name of _Paradise_, they enjoyed a cool and elegant\n",
      "repose; and, after the daily use of the bath, the Barbarians were seated\n",
      "at a table profusely spread with the delicacies of the land and sea.\n",
      "Their silken robes loosely flowing, after the fashion of the Medes, were\n",
      "embroidered with gold; love and hunting were the labors of their life,\n",
      "and their vacant hours were amused by pantomimes, chariot-races, and the\n",
      "music and dances of the theatre.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a march of ten or twelve days, the vigilance of Belisarius was\n",
      "constantly awake and active against his unseen enemies, by whom, in\n",
      "every place, and at every hour, he might be suddenly attacked. An\n",
      "officer of confidence and merit, John the Armenian, led the vanguard of\n",
      "three hundred horse; six hundred MassagetÊ covered at a certain distance\n",
      "the left flank; and the whole fleet, steering along the coast, seldom\n",
      "lost sight of the army, which moved each day about twelve miles, and\n",
      "lodged in the evening in strong camps, or in friendly towns. The near\n",
      "approach of the Romans to Carthage filled the mind of Gelimer with\n",
      "anxiety and terror. He prudently wished to protract the war till his\n",
      "brother, with his veteran troops, should return from the conquest of\n",
      "Sardinia; and he now lamented the rash policy of his ancestors, who, by\n",
      "destroying the fortifications of Africa, had left him only the dangerous\n",
      "resource of risking a battle in the neighborhood of his capital. The\n",
      "Vandal conquerors, from their original number of fifty thousand, were\n",
      "multiplied, without including their women and children, to one hundred\n",
      "and sixty thousand fighting men: and such forces, animated with valor\n",
      "and union, might have crushed, at their first landing, the feeble and\n",
      "exhausted bands of the Roman general. But the friends of the captive\n",
      "king were more inclined to accept the invitations, than to resist\n",
      "the progress, of Belisarius; and many a proud Barbarian disguised\n",
      "his aversion to war under the more specious name of his hatred to\n",
      "the usurper. Yet the authority and promises of Gelimer collected a\n",
      "formidable army, and his plans were concerted with some degree of\n",
      "military skill. An order was despatched to his brother Ammatas, to\n",
      "collect all the forces of Carthage, and to encounter the van of the\n",
      "Roman army at the distance of ten miles from the city: his nephew\n",
      "Gibamund, with two thousand horse, was destined to attack their left,\n",
      "when the monarch himself, who silently followed, should charge their\n",
      "rear, in a situation which excluded them from the aid or even the view\n",
      "of their fleet. But the rashness of Ammatas was fatal to himself and his\n",
      "country. He anticipated the hour of the attack, outstripped his tardy\n",
      "followers, and was pierced with a mortal wound, after he had slain with\n",
      "his own hand twelve of his boldest antagonists. His Vandals fled to\n",
      "Carthage; the highway, almost ten miles, was strewed with dead bodies;\n",
      "and it seemed incredible that such multitudes could be slaughtered by\n",
      "the swords of three hundred Romans. The nephew of Gelimer was defeated,\n",
      "after a slight combat, by the six hundred MassagetÊ: they did not\n",
      "equal the third part of his numbers; but each Scythian was fired by\n",
      "the example of his chief, who gloriously exercised the privilege of his\n",
      "family, by riding, foremost and alone, to shoot the first arrow against\n",
      "the enemy. In the mean while, Gelimer himself, ignorant of the event,\n",
      "and misguided by the windings of the hills, inadvertently passed the\n",
      "Roman army, and reached the scene of action where Ammatas had fallen. He\n",
      "wept the fate of his brother and of Carthage, charged with irresistible\n",
      "fury the advancing squadrons, and might have pursued, and perhaps\n",
      "decided, the victory, if he had not wasted those inestimable moments\n",
      "in the discharge of a vain, though pious, duty to the dead. While his\n",
      "spirit was broken by this mournful office, he heard the trumpet of\n",
      "Belisarius, who, leaving Antonina and his infantry in the camp, pressed\n",
      "forwards with his guards and the remainder of the cavalry to rally his\n",
      "flying troops, and to restore the fortune of the day. Much room could\n",
      "not be found, in this disorderly battle, for the talents of a general;\n",
      "but the king fled before the hero; and the Vandals, accustomed only to a\n",
      "Moorish enemy, were incapable of withstanding the arms and discipline\n",
      "of the Romans. Gelimer retired with hasty steps towards the desert of\n",
      "Numidia: but he had soon the consolation of learning that his private\n",
      "orders for the execution of Hilderic and his captive friends had been\n",
      "faithfully obeyed. The tyrant's revenge was useful only to his enemies.\n",
      "The death of a lawful prince excited the compassion of his people; his\n",
      "life might have perplexed the victorious Romans; and the lieutenant of\n",
      "Justinian, by a crime of which he was innocent, was relieved from\n",
      "the painful alternative of forfeiting his honor or relinquishing his\n",

      "his camp on the field of victory, to which the tenth mile-stone from\n",

      "of Belisarius were the result of calm and intrepid reason, he was soon\n",
      "satisfied that he might confide, without danger, in the peaceful\n",

      "people, with acclamations of gratitude, hailed and invited their Roman\n",
      "deliverers. The defeat of the Vandals, and the freedom of Africa, were\n",
      "announced to the city on the eve of St. Cyprian, when the churches were\n",
      "already adorned and illuminated for the festival of the martyr whom\n",
      "three centuries of superstition had almost raised to a local deity. The\n",
      "Arians, conscious that their reign had expired, resigned the temple to\n",
      "the Catholics, who rescued their saint from profane hands, performed the\n",
      "holy rites, and loudly proclaimed the creed of Athanasius and Justinian.\n",
      "One awful hour reversed the fortunes of the contending parties. The\n",
      "suppliant Vandals, who had so lately indulged the vices of conquerors,\n",
      "sought an humble refuge in the sanctuary of the church; while the\n",
      "merchants of the East were delivered from the deepest dungeon of the\n",
      "palace by their affrighted keeper, who implored the protection of his\n",
      "captives, and showed them, through an aperture in the wall, the sails\n",
      "of the Roman fleet. After their separation from the army, the naval\n",
      "commanders had proceeded with slow caution along the coast till they\n",
      "reached the HermÊan promontory, and obtained the first intelligence of\n",
      "the victory of Belisarius. Faithful to his instructions, they would have\n",
      "cast anchor about twenty miles from Carthage, if the more skilful\n",
      "seamen had not represented the perils of the shore, and the signs of\n",
      "an impending tempest. Still ignorant of the revolution, they declined,\n",

      "adjacent harbor and suburb of Mandracium were insulted only by the\n",
      "rapine of a private officer, who disobeyed and deserted his leaders.\n",
      "But the Imperial fleet, advancing with a fair wind, steered through the\n",
      "narrow entrance of the Goletta, and occupied, in the deep and capacious\n",
      "lake of Tunis, a secure station about five miles from the capital. No\n",
      "sooner was Belisarius informed of their arrival, than he despatched\n",
      "orders that the greatest part of the mariners should be immediately\n",
      "landed to join the triumph, and to swell the apparent numbers, of\n",
      "the Romans. Before he allowed them to enter the gates of Carthage, he\n",
      "exhorted them, in a discourse worthy of himself and the occasion, not to\n",
      "disgrace the glory of their arms; and to remember that the Vandals had\n",
      "been the tyrants, but that they were the deliverers, of the Africans,\n",
      "who must now be respected as the voluntary and affectionate subjects of\n",
      "their common sovereign. The Romans marched through the streets in close\n",
      "ranks prepared for battle if an enemy had appeared: the strict\n",
      "order maintained by the general imprinted on their minds the duty of\n",
      "obedience; and in an age in which custom and impunity almost sanctified\n",
      "the abuse of conquest, the genius of one man repressed the passions of a\n",
      "victorious army. The voice of menace and complaint was silent; the trade\n",
      "of Carthage was not interrupted; while Africa changed her master and her\n",
      "government, the shops continued open and busy; and the soldiers, after\n",
      "sufficient guards had been posted, modestly departed to the houses which\n",
      "were allotted for their reception. Belisarius fixed his residence in\n",
      "the palace; seated himself on the throne of Genseric; accepted and\n",
      "distributed the Barbaric spoil; granted their lives to the suppliant\n",
      "Vandals; and labored to repair the damage which the suburb of Mandracium\n",
      "had sustained in the preceding night. At supper he entertained his\n",
      "principal officers with the form and magnificence of a royal banquet.\n",
      "The victor was respectfully served by the captive officers of the\n",
      "household; and in the moments of festivity, when the impartial\n",
      "spectators applauded the fortune and merit of Belisarius, his envious\n",
      "flatterers secretly shed their venom on every word and gesture which\n",
      "might alarm the suspicions of a jealous monarch. One day was given to\n",
      "these pompous scenes, which may not be despised as useless, if they\n",
      "attracted the popular veneration; but the active mind of Belisarius,\n",
      "which in the pride of victory could suppose a defeat, had already\n",
      "resolved that the Roman empire in Africa should not depend on the chance\n",
      "of arms, or the favor of the people. The fortifications of Carthage\n",
      "had alone been exempted from the general proscription; but in the reign\n",
      "of ninety-five years they were suffered to decay by the thoughtless and\n",
      "indolent Vandals. A wiser conqueror restored, with incredible despatch,\n",
      "the walls and ditches of the city. His liberality encouraged the\n",
      "workmen; the soldiers, the mariners, and the citizens, vied with each\n",
      "other in the salutary labor; and Gelimer, who had feared to trust his\n",
      "person in an open town, beheld with astonishment and despair, the rising\n",
      "strength of an impregnable fortress.\n",
      "\n",
      "That unfortunate monarch, after the loss of his capital, applied himself\n",
      "to collect the remains of an army scattered, rather than destroyed, by\n",
      "the preceding battle; and the hopes of pillage attracted some Moorish\n",
      "bands to the standard of Gelimer. He encamped in the fields of Bulla,\n",
      "four days' journey from Carthage; insulted the capital, which he\n",
      "deprived of the use of an aqueduct; proposed a high reward for the\n",
      "head of every Roman; affected to spare the persons and property of his\n",
      "African subjects, and secretly negotiated with the Arian sectaries\n",
      "and the confederate Huns. Under these circumstances, the conquest of\n",
      "Sardinia served only to aggravate his distress: he reflected, with the\n",
      "deepest anguish, that he had wasted, in that useless enterprise, five\n",
      "thousand of his bravest troops; and he read, with grief and shame,\n",
      "the victorious letters of his brother Zano, who expressed a sanguine\n",
      "confidence that the king, after the example of their ancestors, had\n",
      "already chastised the rashness of the Roman invader. \"Alas! my brother,\"\n",
      "replied Gelimer, \"Heaven has declared against our unhappy nation. While\n",
      "you have subdued Sardinia, we have lost Africa. No sooner did Belisarius\n",
      "appear with a handful of soldiers, than courage and prosperity deserted\n",
      "the cause of the Vandals. Your nephew Gibamund, your brother Ammatas,\n",
      "have been betrayed to death by the cowardice of their followers. Our\n",
      "horses, our ships, Carthage itself, and all Africa, are in the power of\n",
      "the enemy. Yet the Vandals still prefer an ignominious repose, at the\n",
      "expense of their wives and children, their wealth and liberty. Nothing\n",
      "now remains, except the fields of Bulla, and the hope of your valor.\n",
      "Abandon Sardinia; fly to our relief; restore our empire, or perish by\n",
      "our side.\" On the receipt of this epistle, Zano imparted his grief to\n",
      "the principal Vandals; but the intelligence was prudently concealed from\n",
      "the natives of the island. The troops embarked in one hundred and\n",
      "twenty galleys at the port of Cagliari, cast anchor the third day on\n",
      "the confines of Mauritania, and hastily pursued their march to join the\n",
      "royal standard in the camp of Bulla. Mournful was the interview: the two\n",
      "brothers embraced; they wept in silence; no questions were asked of the\n",
      "Sardinian victory; no inquiries were made of the African misfortunes:\n",
      "they saw before their eyes the whole extent of their calamities; and\n",
      "the absence of their wives and children afforded a melancholy proof that\n",
      "either death or captivity had been their lot. The languid spirit of the\n",
      "Vandals was at length awakened and united by the entreaties of their\n",
      "king, the example of Zano, and the instant danger which threatened their\n",
      "monarchy and religion. The military strength of the nation advanced to\n",
      "battle; and such was the rapid increase, that before their army reached\n",
      "Tricameron, about twenty miles from Carthage, they might boast, perhaps\n",
      "with some exaggeration, that they surpassed, in a tenfold proportion,\n",
      "the diminutive powers of the Romans. But these powers were under the\n",
      "command of Belisarius; and, as he was conscious of their superior merit,\n",
      "he permitted the Barbarians to surprise him at an unseasonable hour.\n",
      "The Romans were instantly under arms; a rivulet covered their front; the\n",
      "cavalry formed the first line, which Belisarius supported in the centre,\n",
      "at the head of five hundred guards; the infantry, at some distance, was\n",
      "posted in the second line; and the vigilance of the general watched\n",
      "the separate station and ambiguous faith of the MassagetÊ, who secretly\n",
      "reserved their aid for the conquerors. The historian has inserted, and\n",
      "the reader may easily supply, the speeches of the commanders, who,\n",
      "by arguments the most apposite to their situation, inculcated the\n",
      "importance of victory, and the contempt of life. Zano, with the troops\n",
      "which had followed him to the conquest of Sardinia, was placed in the\n",
      "centre; and the throne of Genseric might have stood, if the multitude\n",
      "of Vandals had imitated their intrepid resolution. Casting away their\n",
      "lances and missile weapons, they drew their swords, and expected the\n",
      "charge: the Roman cavalry thrice passed the rivulet; they were thrice\n",
      "repulsed; and the conflict was firmly maintained, till Zano fell, and\n",
      "the standard of Belisarius was displayed. Gelimer retreated to his camp;\n",
      "the Huns joined the pursuit; and the victors despoiled the bodies of\n",
      "the slain. Yet no more than fifty Romans, and eight hundred Vandals were\n",
      "found on the field of battle; so inconsiderable was the carnage of a\n",
      "day, which extinguished a nation, and transferred the empire of Africa.\n",
      "In the evening Belisarius led his infantry to the attack of the camp;\n",
      "and the pusillanimous flight of Gelimer exposed the vanity of his recent\n",
      "declarations, that to the vanquished, death was a relief, life a burden,\n",
      "and infamy the only object of terror. His departure was secret; but as\n",
      "soon as the Vandals discovered that their king had deserted them, they\n",
      "hastily dispersed, anxious only for their personal safety, and careless\n",
      "of every object that is dear or valuable to mankind. The Romans entered\n",
      "the camp without resistance; and the wildest scenes of disorder were\n",
      "veiled in the darkness and confusion of the night. Every Barbarian who\n",
      "met their swords was inhumanly massacred; their widows and daughters,\n",
      "as rich heirs, or beautiful concubines, were embraced by the licentious\n",
      "soldiers; and avarice itself was almost satiated with the treasures of\n",
      "gold and silver, the accumulated fruits of conquest or economy in a long\n",
      "period of prosperity and peace. In this frantic search, the troops, even\n",
      "of Belisarius, forgot their caution and respect. Intoxicated with lust\n",
      "and rapine, they explored, in small parties, or alone, the adjacent\n",
      "fields, the woods, the rocks, and the caverns, that might possibly\n",
      "conceal any desirable prize: laden with booty, they deserted their\n",
      "ranks, and wandered without a guide, on the high road to Carthage; and\n",
      "if the flying enemies had dared to return, very few of the conquerors\n",
      "would have escaped. Deeply sensible of the disgrace and danger,\n",
      "Belisarius passed an apprehensive night on the field of victory: at the\n",
      "dawn of day, he planted his standard on a hill, recalled his guardians\n",
      "and veterans, and gradually restored the modesty and obedience of the\n",
      "camp. It was equally the concern of the Roman general to subdue the\n",
      "hostile, and to save the prostrate, Barbarian; and the suppliant\n",
      "Vandals, who could be found only in churches, were protected by his\n",
      "authority, disarmed, and separately confined, that they might neither\n",
      "disturb the public peace, nor become the victims of popular revenge.\n",
      "After despatching a light detachment to tread the footsteps of Gelimer,\n",
      "he advanced, with his whole army, about ten days' march, as far as\n",
      "Hippo Regius, which no longer possessed the relics of St. Augustin.\n",
      "The season, and the certain intelligence that the Vandal had fled to an\n",
      "inaccessible country of the Moors, determined Belisarius to relinquish\n",
      "the vain pursuit, and to fix his winter quarters at Carthage. From\n",
      "thence he despatched his principal lieutenant, to inform the emperor,\n",
      "that in the space of three months he had achieved the conquest of\n",
      "Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Belisarius spoke the language of truth. The surviving Vandals yielded,\n",
      "without resistance, their arms and their freedom; the neighborhood of\n",
      "Carthage submitted to his presence; and the more distant provinces were\n",
      "successively subdued by the report of his victory. Tripoli was confirmed\n",
      "in her voluntary allegiance; Sardinia and Corsica surrendered to an\n",
      "officer, who carried, instead of a sword, the head of the valiant Zano;\n",
      "and the Isles of Majorca, Minorca, and Yvica consented to remain an\n",
      "humble appendage of the African kingdom. CÊsarea, a royal city, which in\n",
      "looser geography may be confounded with the modern Algiers, was situate\n",
      "thirty days' march to the westward of Carthage: by land, the road was\n",
      "infested by the Moors; but the sea was open, and the Romans were now\n",
      "masters of the sea. An active and discreet tribune sailed as far as\n",
      "the Straits, where he occupied Septem or Ceuta, which rises opposite to\n",
      "Gibraltar on the African coast; that remote place was afterwards adorned\n",
      "and fortified by Justinian; and he seems to have indulged the vain\n",
      "ambition of extending his empire to the columns of Hercules. He received\n",
      "the messengers of victory at the time when he was preparing to publish\n",
      "the Pandects of the Roman laws; and the devout or jealous emperor\n",
      "celebrated the divine goodness, and confessed, in silence, the merit of\n",
      "his successful general. Impatient to abolish the temporal and spiritual\n",
      "tyranny of the Vandals, he proceeded, without delay, to the full\n",
      "establishment of the Catholic church. Her jurisdiction, wealth, and\n",
      "immunities, perhaps the most essential part of episcopal religion,\n",
      "were restored and amplified with a liberal hand; the Arian worship was\n",
      "suppressed; the Donatist meetings were proscribed; and the synod of\n",
      "Carthage, by the voice of two hundred and seventeen bishops, applauded\n",
      "the just measure of pious retaliation. On such an occasion, it may\n",
      "not be presumed, that many orthodox prelates were absent; but the\n",
      "comparative smallness of their number, which in ancient councils had\n",
      "been twice or even thrice multiplied, most clearly indicates the decay\n",
      "both of the church and state. While Justinian approved himself the\n",
      "defender of the faith, he entertained an ambitious hope, that his\n",
      "victorious lieutenant would speedily enlarge the narrow limits of his\n",
      "dominion to the space which they occupied before the invasion of the\n",
      "Moors and Vandals; and Belisarius was instructed to establish _five_\n",
      "dukes or commanders in the convenient stations of Tripoli, Leptis,\n",
      "Cirta, CÊsarea, and Sardinia, and to compute the military force of\n",
      "_palatines_ or _borderers_ that might be sufficient for the defence of\n",
      "Africa. The kingdom of the Vandals was not unworthy of the presence of a\n",
      "PrÊtorian prÊfect; and four consulars, three presidents, were appointed\n",
      "to administer the seven provinces under his civil jurisdiction. The\n",
      "number of their subordinate officers, clerks, messengers, or assistants,\n",
      "was minutely expressed; three hundred and ninety-six for the prÊfect\n",
      "himself, fifty for each of his vicegerents; and the rigid definition of\n",
      "their fees and salaries was more effectual to confirm the right than to\n",
      "prevent the abuse. These magistrates might be oppressive, but they\n",
      "were not idle; and the subtile questions of justice and revenue were\n",
      "infinitely propagated under the new government, which professed to\n",
      "revive the freedom and equity of the Roman republic. The conqueror was\n",
      "solicitous to extract a prompt and plentiful supply from his African\n",
      "subjects; and he allowed them to claim, even in the third degree, and\n",
      "from the collateral line, the houses and lands of which their families\n",
      "had been unjustly despoiled by the Vandals. After the departure of\n",
      "Belisarius, who acted by a high and special commission, no ordinary\n",
      "provision was made for a master-general of the forces; but the office\n",
      "of PrÊtorian prÊfect was intrusted to a soldier; the civil and military\n",
      "powers were united, according to the practice of Justinian, in the chief\n",
      "governor; and the representative of the emperor in Africa, as well as in\n",
      "Italy, was soon distinguished by the appellation of Exarch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the conquest of Africa was imperfect till her former sovereign was\n",
      "delivered, either alive or dead, into the hands of the Romans. Doubtful\n",
      "of the event, Gelimer had given secret orders that a part of his\n",
      "treasure should be transported to Spain, where he hoped to find a secure\n",
      "refuge at the court of the king of the Visigoths. But these intentions\n",
      "were disappointed by accident, treachery, and the indefatigable pursuit\n",
      "of his enemies, who intercepted his flight from the sea-shore, and\n",
      "chased the unfortunate monarch, with some faithful followers, to the\n",
      "inaccessible mountain of Papua, in the inland country of Numidia. He was\n",
      "immediately besieged by Pharas, an officer whose truth and sobriety were\n",
      "the more applauded, as such qualities could seldom be found among the\n",
      "Heruli, the most corrupt of the Barbarian tribes. To his vigilance\n",
      "Belisarius had intrusted this important charge and, after a bold attempt\n",
      "to scale the mountain, in which he lost a hundred and ten soldiers,\n",
      "Pharas expected, during a winter siege, the operation of distress\n",
      "and famine on the mind of the Vandal king. From the softest habits of\n",
      "pleasure, from the unbounded command of industry and wealth, he\n",
      "was reduced to share the poverty of the Moors, supportable only to\n",
      "themselves by their ignorance of a happier condition. In their rude\n",
      "hovels, of mud and hurdles, which confined the smoke and excluded the\n",
      "light, they promiscuously slept on the ground, perhaps on a sheep-skin,\n",
      "with their wives, their children, and their cattle. Sordid and scanty\n",
      "were their garments; the use of bread and wine was unknown; and their\n",
      "oaten or barley cakes, imperfectly baked in the ashes, were devoured\n",
      "almost in a crude state, by the hungry savages. The health of Gelimer\n",
      "must have sunk under these strange and unwonted hardships, from\n",
      "whatsoever cause they had been endured; but his actual misery was\n",
      "imbittered by the recollection of past greatness, the daily insolence\n",
      "of his protectors, and the just apprehension, that the light and\n",
      "venal Moors might be tempted to betray the rights of hospitality. The\n",
      "knowledge of his situation dictated the humane and friendly epistle\n",
      "of Pharas. \"Like yourself,\" said the chief of the Heruli, \"I am an\n",
      "illiterate Barbarian, but I speak the language of plain sense and an\n",
      "honest heart. Why will you persist in hopeless obstinacy? Why will\n",
      "you ruin yourself, your family, and nation? The love of freedom and\n",
      "abhorrence of slavery? Alas! my dearest Gelimer, are you not already the\n",
      "worst of slaves, the slave of the vile nation of the Moors? Would it\n",
      "not be preferable to sustain at Constantinople a life of poverty and\n",
      "servitude, rather than to reign the undoubted monarch of the mountain\n",
      "of Papua? Do you think it a disgrace to be the subject of Justinian?\n",
      "Belisarius is his subject; and we ourselves, whose birth is not inferior\n",
      "to your own, are not ashamed of our obedience to the Roman emperor. That\n",
      "generous prince will grant you a rich inheritance of lands, a place\n",
      "in the senate, and the dignity of patrician: such are his gracious\n",
      "intentions, and you may depend with full assurance on the word of\n",
      "Belisarius. So long as Heaven has condemned us to suffer, patience is a\n",
      "virtue; but if we reject the proffered deliverance, it degenerates into\n",
      "blind and stupid despair.\" \"I am not insensible,\" replied the king of the\n",
      "Vandals, \"how kind and rational is your advice. But I cannot persuade\n",
      "myself to become the slave of an unjust enemy, who has deserved my\n",
      "implacable hatred. _Him_ I had never injured either by word or deed: yet\n",
      "he has sent against me, I know not from whence, a certain Belisarius,\n",
      "who has cast me headlong from the throne into his abyss of misery.\n",
      "Justinian is a man; he is a prince; does he not dread for himself a\n",
      "similar reverse of fortune? I can write no more: my grief oppresses me.\n",
      "Send me, I beseech you, my dear Pharas, send me, a lyre, a sponge, and\n",
      "a loaf of bread.\" From the Vandal messenger, Pharas was informed of the\n",
      "motives of this singular request. It was long since the king of Africa\n",
      "had tasted bread; a defluxion had fallen on his eyes, the effect of\n",
      "fatigue or incessant weeping; and he wished to solace the melancholy\n",
      "hours, by singing to the lyre the sad story of his own misfortunes. The\n",
      "humanity of Pharas was moved; he sent the three extraordinary gifts; but\n",
      "even his humanity prompted him to redouble the vigilance of his guard,\n",
      "that he might sooner compel his prisoner to embrace a resolution\n",
      "advantageous to the Romans, but salutary to himself. The obstinacy of\n",
      "Gelimer at length yielded to reason and necessity; the solemn assurances\n",
      "of safety and honorable treatment were ratified in the emperor's name,\n",
      "by the ambassador of Belisarius; and the king of the Vandals descended\n",
      "from the mountain. The first public interview was in one of the suburbs\n",
      "of Carthage; and when the royal captive accosted his conqueror, he burst\n",
      "into a fit of laughter. The crowd might naturally believe, that extreme\n",
      "grief had deprived Gelimer of his senses: but in this mournful state,\n",
      "unseasonable mirth insinuated to more intelligent observers, that the\n",
      "vain and transitory scenes of human greatness are unworthy of a serious\n",
      "thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their contempt was soon justified by a new example of a vulgar truth;\n",
      "that flattery adheres to power, and envy to superior merit. The chiefs\n",
      "of the Roman army presumed to think themselves the rivals of a hero.\n",
      "Their private despatches maliciously affirmed, that the conqueror of\n",
      "Africa, strong in his reputation and the public love, conspired to\n",
      "seat himself on the throne of the Vandals. Justinian listened with too\n",
      "patient an ear; and his silence was the result of jealousy rather than\n",
      "of confidence. An honorable alternative, of remaining in the province,\n",
      "or of returning to the capital, was indeed submitted to the discretion\n",
      "of Belisarius; but he wisely concluded, from intercepted letters and\n",
      "the knowledge of his sovereign's temper, that he must either resign his\n",
      "head, erect his standard, or confound his enemies by his presence\n",
      "and submission. Innocence and courage decided his choice; his guards,\n",
      "captives, and treasures, were diligently embarked; and so prosperous was\n",
      "the navigation, that his arrival at Constantinople preceded any certain\n",
      "account of his departure from the port of Carthage. Such unsuspecting\n",
      "loyalty removed the apprehensions of Justinian; envy was silenced and\n",
      "inflamed by the public gratitude; and the third Africanus obtained the\n",
      "honors of a triumph, a ceremony which the city of Constantine had never\n",
      "seen, and which ancient Rome, since the reign of Tiberius, had reserved\n",
      "for the _auspicious_ arms of the CÊsars. From the palace of Belisarius,\n",
      "the procession was conducted through the principal streets to the\n",
      "hippodrome; and this memorable day seemed to avenge the injuries of\n",
      "Genseric, and to expiate the shame of the Romans. The wealth of nations\n",
      "was displayed, the trophies of martial or effeminate luxury; rich armor,\n",
      "golden thrones, and the chariots of state which had been used by the\n",
      "Vandal queen; the massy furniture of the royal banquet, the splendor\n",
      "of precious stones, the elegant forms of statues and vases, the more\n",
      "substantial treasure of gold, and the holy vessels of the Jewish temple,\n",
      "which after their long peregrination were respectfully deposited in\n",
      "the Christian church of Jerusalem. A long train of the noblest Vandals\n",
      "reluctantly exposed their lofty stature and manly countenance. Gelimer\n",
      "slowly advanced: he was clad in a purple robe, and still maintained\n",
      "the majesty of a king. Not a tear escaped from his eyes, not a sigh was\n",
      "heard; but his pride or piety derived some secret consolation from the\n",
      "words of Solomon, which he repeatedly pronounced, Vanity! vanity! all\n",
      "is vanity! Instead of ascending a triumphal car drawn by four horses or\n",
      "elephants, the modest conqueror marched on foot at the head of his brave\n",
      "companions; his prudence might decline an honor too conspicuous for a\n",
      "subject; and his magnanimity might justly disdain what had been so often\n",
      "sullied by the vilest of tyrants. The glorious procession entered the\n",
      "gate of the hippodrome; was saluted by the acclamations of the senate\n",
      "and people; and halted before the throne where Justinian and Theodora\n",
      "were seated to receive homage of the captive monarch and the victorious\n",
      "hero. They both performed the customary adoration; and falling prostrate\n",
      "on the ground, respectfully touched the footstool of a prince who had\n",
      "not unsheathed his sword, and of a prostitute who had danced on the\n",
      "theatre; some gentle violence was used to bend the stubborn spirit of\n",
      "the grandson of Genseric; and however trained to servitude, the genius\n",
      "of Belisarius must have secretly rebelled. He was immediately declared\n",
      "consul for the ensuing year, and the day of his inauguration resembled\n",
      "the pomp of a second triumph: his curule chair was borne aloft on the\n",
      "shoulders of captive Vandals; and the spoils of war, gold cups, and rich\n",
      "girdles, were profusely scattered among the populace.\n",

      "treaty for which his honor had been pledged to the king of the Vandals.\n",
      "The religious scruples of Gelimer, who adhered to the Arian heresy, were\n",
      "incompatible with the dignity of senator or patrician: but he received\n",
      "from the emperor an ample estate in the province of Galatia, where the\n",
      "abdicated monarch retired, with his family and friends, to a life of\n",
      "peace, of affluence, and perhaps of content. The daughters of Hilderic\n",
      "were entertained with the respectful tenderness due to their age and\n",
      "misfortune; and Justinian and Theodora accepted the honor of educating\n",
      "and enriching the female descendants of the great Theodosius. The\n",
      "bravest of the Vandal youth were distributed into five squadrons of\n",
      "cavalry, which adopted the name of their benefactor, and supported\n",
      "in the Persian wars the glory of their ancestors. But these rare\n",
      "exceptions, the reward of birth or valor, are insufficient to explain\n",
      "the fate of a nation, whose numbers before a short and bloodless war,\n",
      "amounted to more than six hundred thousand persons. After the exile of\n",
      "their king and nobles, the servile crowd might purchase their safety by\n",
      "abjuring their character, religion, and language; and their degenerate\n",
      "posterity would be insensibly mingled with the common herd of African\n",
      "subjects. Yet even in the present age, and in the heart of the Moorish\n",
      "tribes, a curious traveller has discovered the white complexion and long\n",
      "flaxen hair of a northern race; and it was formerly believed, that the\n",
      "boldest of the Vandals fled beyond the power, or even the knowledge,\n",
      "of the Romans, to enjoy their solitary freedom on the shores of the\n",
      "Atlantic Ocean. Africa had been their empire, it became their prison;\n",
      "nor could they entertain a hope, or even a wish, of returning to the\n",
      "banks of the Elbe, where their brethren, of a spirit less adventurous,\n",
      "still wandered in their native forests. It was impossible for cowards\n",
      "to surmount the barriers of unknown seas and hostile Barbarians; it was\n",
      "impossible for brave men to expose their nakedness and defeat before the\n",
      "eyes of their countrymen, to describe the kingdoms which they had lost,\n",
      "and to claim a share of the humble inheritance, which, in a happier\n",
      "hour, they had almost unanimously renounced. In the country between the\n",
      "Elbe and the Oder, several populous villages of Lusatia are inhabited by\n",
      "the Vandals: they still preserve their language, their customs, and\n",
      "the purity of their blood; support, with some impatience, the Saxon\n",
      "or Prussian yoke; and serve, with secret and voluntary allegiance, the\n",
      "descendant of their ancient kings, who in his garb and present fortune\n",
      "is confounded with the meanest of his vassals. The name and situation of\n",
      "this unhappy people might indicate their descent from one common stock\n",
      "with the conquerors of Africa. But the use of a Sclavonian dialect more\n",
      "clearly represent them as the last remnant of the new colonies, who\n",
      "succeeded to the genuine Vandals, already scattered or destroyed in the\n",
      "age of Procopius.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Belisarius had been tempted to hesitate in his allegiance, he might\n",
      "have urged, even against the emperor himself, the indispensable duty of\n",
      "saving Africa from an enemy more barbarous than the Vandals. The origin\n",
      "of the Moors is involved in darkness; they were ignorant of the use of\n",
      "letters. Their limits cannot be precisely defined; a boundless continent\n",
      "was open to the Libyan shepherds; the change of seasons and pastures\n",
      "regulated their motions; and their rude huts and slender furniture were\n",
      "transported with the same case as their arms, their families, and their\n",
      "cattle, which consisted of sheep, oxen, and camels. During the vigor of\n",
      "the Roman power, they observed a respectful distance from Carthage and\n",
      "the sea-shore: under the feeble reign of the Vandals, they invaded the\n",
      "cities of Numidia, occupied the sea-coast from Tangier to CÊsarea, and\n",
      "pitched their camps, with impunity, in the fertile province of Byzacium.\n",
      "The formidable strength and artful conduct of Belisarius secured the\n",
      "neutrality of the Moorish princes, whose vanity aspired to receive,\n",
      "in the emperor's name, the ensigns of their regal dignity. They were\n",
      "astonished by the rapid event, and trembled in the presence of their\n",
      "conqueror. But his approaching departure soon relieved the apprehensions\n",
      "of a savage and superstitious people; the number of their wives allowed\n",
      "them to disregard the safety of their infant hostages; and when the\n",
      "Roman general hoisted sail in the port of Carthage, he heard the\n",
      "cries, and almost beheld the flames, of the desolated province. Yet he\n",
      "persisted in his resolution, and leaving only a part of his guards to\n",
      "reÎnforce the feeble garrisons, he intrusted the command of Africa to\n",
      "the eunuch Solomon, who proved himself not unworthy to be the successor\n",
      "of Belisarius. In the first invasion, some detachments, with two\n",
      "officers of merit, were surprised and intercepted; but Solomon speedily\n",
      "assembled his troops, marched from Carthage into the heart of the\n",
      "country, and in two great battles destroyed sixty thousand of the\n",
      "Barbarians. The Moors depended on their multitude, their swiftness, and\n",
      "their inaccessible mountains; and the aspect and smell of their camels\n",
      "are said to have produced some confusion in the Roman cavalry. But as\n",
      "soon as they were commanded to dismount, they derided this contemptible\n",
      "obstacle: as soon as the columns ascended the hills, the naked and\n",
      "disorderly crowd was dazzled by glittering arms and regular evolutions;\n",
      "and the menace of their female prophets was repeatedly fulfilled,\n",
      "that the Moors should be discomfited by a _beardless_ antagonist. The\n",
      "victorious eunuch advanced thirteen days journey from Carthage, to\n",
      "besiege Mount Aurasius, the citadel, and at the same time the garden,\n",
      "of Numidia. That range of hills, a branch of the great Atlas, contains,\n",
      "within a circumference of one hundred and twenty miles, a rare variety\n",
      "of soil and climate; the intermediate valleys and elevated plains abound\n",
      "with rich pastures, perpetual streams, and fruits of a delicious taste\n",
      "and uncommon magnitude. This fair solitude is decorated with the ruins\n",
      "of Lambesa, a Roman city, once the seat of a legion, and the residence\n",
      "of forty thousand inhabitants. The Ionic temple of ∆sculapius is\n",
      "encompassed with Moorish huts; and the cattle now graze in the midst\n",
      "of an amphitheatre, under the shade of Corinthian columns. A sharp\n",
      "perpendicular rock rises above the level of the mountain, where the\n",
      "African princes deposited their wives and treasure; and a proverb is\n",
      "familiar to the Arabs, that the man may eat fire who dares to attack\n",
      "the craggy cliffs and inhospitable natives of Mount Aurasius. This hardy\n",
      "enterprise was twice attempted by the eunuch Solomon: from the first,\n",
      "he retreated with some disgrace; and in the second, his patience and\n",
      "provisions were almost exhausted; and he must again have retired, if he\n",
      "had not yielded to the impetuous courage of his troops, who audaciously\n",
      "scaled, to the astonishment of the Moors, the mountain, the hostile\n",
      "camp, and the summit of the Geminian rock A citadel was erected to\n",
      "secure this important conquest, and to remind the Barbarians of their\n",
      "defeat; and as Solomon pursued his march to the west, the long-lost\n",
      "province of Mauritanian Sitifi was again annexed to the Roman empire.\n",
      "The Moorish war continued several years after the departure of\n",
      "Belisarius; but the laurels which he resigned to a faithful lieutenant\n",
      "may be justly ascribed to his own triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "The experience of past faults, which may sometimes correct the mature\n",
      "age of an individual, is seldom profitable to the successive generations\n",
      "of mankind. The nations of antiquity, careless of each other's safety,\n",
      "were separately vanquished and enslaved by the Romans. This awful lesson\n",
      "might have instructed the Barbarians of the West to oppose, with timely\n",
      "counsels and confederate arms, the unbounded ambition of Justinian. Yet\n",
      "the same error was repeated, the same consequences were felt, and the\n",
      "Goths, both of Italy and Spain, insensible of their approaching danger,\n",
      "beheld with indifference, and even with joy, the rapid downfall of the\n",
      "Vandals. After the failure of the royal line, Theudes, a valiant and\n",
      "powerful chief, ascended the throne of Spain, which he had formerly\n",
      "administered in the name of Theodoric and his infant grandson. Under\n",
      "his command, the Visigoths besieged the fortress of Ceuta on the African\n",
      "coast: but, while they spent the Sabbath day in peace and devotion, the\n",
      "pious security of their camp was invaded by a sally from the town; and\n",
      "the king himself, with some difficulty and danger, escaped from the\n",
      "hands of a sacrilegious enemy. It was not long before his pride and\n",
      "resentment were gratified by a suppliant embassy from the unfortunate\n",
      "Gelimer, who implored, in his distress, the aid of the Spanish monarch.\n",
      "But instead of sacrificing these unworthy passions to the dictates of\n",
      "generosity and prudence, Theudes amused the ambassadors till he was\n",
      "secretly informed of the loss of Carthage, and then dismissed them with\n",
      "obscure and contemptuous advice, to seek in their native country a\n",
      "true knowledge of the state of the Vandals. The long continuance of the\n",
      "Italian war delayed the punishment of the Visigoths; and the eyes\n",
      "of Theudes were closed before they tasted the fruits of his mistaken\n",
      "policy. After his death, the sceptre of Spain was disputed by a civil\n",
      "war. The weaker candidate solicited the protection of Justinian, and\n",
      "ambitiously subscribed a treaty of alliance, which deeply wounded the\n",
      "independence and happiness of his country. Several cities, both on\n",
      "the ocean and the Mediterranean, were ceded to the Roman troops, who\n",
      "afterwards refused to evacuate those pledges, as it should seem, either\n",
      "of safety or payment; and as they were fortified by perpetual supplies\n",
      "from Africa, they maintained their impregnable stations, for the\n",
      "mischievous purpose of inflaming the civil and religious factions of\n",
      "the Barbarians. Seventy years elapsed before this painful thorn could be\n",
      "extirpated from the bosom of the monarchy; and as long as the emperors\n",
      "retained any share of these remote and useless possessions, their vanity\n",
      "might number Spain in the list of their provinces, and the successors of\n",
      "Alaric in the rank of their vassals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The error of the Goths who reigned in Italy was less excusable than that\n",
      "of their Spanish brethren, and their punishment was still more immediate\n",
      "and terrible. From a motive of private revenge, they enabled their most\n",
      "dangerous enemy to destroy their most valuable ally. A sister of the\n",
      "great Theodoric had been given in marriage to Thrasimond, the African\n",
      "king: on this occasion, the fortress of LilybÊum in Sicily was resigned\n",
      "to the Vandals; and the princess Amalafrida was attended by a martial\n",
      "train of one thousand nobles, and five thousand Gothic soldiers, who\n",
      "signalized their valor in the Moorish wars. Their merit was overrated\n",
      "by themselves, and perhaps neglected by the Vandals; they viewed the\n",
      "country with envy, and the conquerors with disdain; but their real\n",
      "or fictitious conspiracy was prevented by a massacre; the Goths were\n",
      "oppressed, and the captivity of Amalafrida was soon followed by her\n",
      "secret and suspicious death. The eloquent pen of Cassiodorus was\n",
      "employed to reproach the Vandal court with the cruel violation of every\n",
      "social and public duty; but the vengeance which he threatened in the\n",
      "name of his sovereign might be derided with impunity, as long as Africa\n",
      "was protected by the sea, and the Goths were destitute of a navy. In\n",
      "the blind impotence of grief and indignation, they joyfully saluted the\n",
      "approach of the Romans, entertained the fleet of Belisarius in the ports\n",
      "of Sicily, and were speedily delighted or alarmed by the surprising\n",
      "intelligence, that their revenge was executed beyond the measure of\n",
      "their hopes, or perhaps of their wishes. To their friendship the emperor\n",
      "was indebted for the kingdom of Africa, and the Goths might reasonably\n",
      "think, that they were entitled to resume the possession of a barren\n",
      "rock, so recently separated as a nuptial gift from the island of Sicily.\n",
      "They were soon undeceived by the haughty mandate of Belisarius, which\n",
      "excited their tardy and unavailing repentance. \"The city and promontory\n",

      "claim them by the right of conquest. Your submission may deserve the\n",
      "favor of the emperor; your obstinacy will provoke his displeasure, and\n",
      "must kindle a war, that can terminate only in your utter ruin. If\n",
      "you compel us to take up arms, we shall contend, not to regain the\n",
      "possession of a single city, but to deprive you of all the provinces\n",

      "Justinian and his lieutenant: but a spirit of discord and disaffection\n",
      "prevailed in Italy, and the Goths supported, with reluctance, the\n",

      "The birth of Amalasontha, the regent and queen of Italy, united the two\n",
      "most illustrious families of the Barbarians. Her mother, the sister of\n",
      "Clovis, was descended from the long-haired kings of the _Merovingian_\n",
      "race; and the regal succession of the _Amali_ was illustrated in the\n",
      "eleventh generation, by her father, the great Theodoric, whose merit\n",
      "might have ennobled a plebeian origin. The sex of his daughter excluded\n",
      "her from the Gothic throne; but his vigilant tenderness for his family\n",
      "and his people discovered the last heir of the royal line, whose\n",
      "ancestors had taken refuge in Spain; and the fortunate Eutharic was\n",
      "suddenly exalted to the rank of a consul and a prince. He enjoyed only\n",
      "a short time the charms of Amalasontha, and the hopes of the succession;\n",
      "and his widow, after the death of her husband and father, was left the\n",
      "guardian of her son Athalaric, and the kingdom of Italy. At the age\n",
      "of about twenty-eight years, the endowments of her mind and person had\n",
      "attained their perfect maturity. Her beauty, which, in the apprehension\n",
      "of Theodora herself, might have disputed the conquest of an emperor,\n",
      "was animated by manly sense, activity, and resolution. Education and\n",
      "experience had cultivated her talents; her philosophic studies were\n",
      "exempt from vanity; and, though she expressed herself with equal\n",
      "elegance and ease in the Greek, the Latin, and the Gothic tongue,\n",
      "the daughter of Theodoric maintained in her counsels a discreet and\n",
      "impenetrable silence. By a faithful imitation of the virtues, she\n",
      "revived the prosperity, of his reign; while she strove, with pious\n",
      "care, to expiate the faults, and to obliterate the darker memory of his\n",
      "declining age. The children of Boethius and Symmachus were restored\n",
      "to their paternal inheritance; her extreme lenity never consented to\n",
      "inflict any corporal or pecuniary penalties on her Roman subjects; and\n",
      "she generously despised the clamors of the Goths, who, at the end of\n",
      "forty years, still considered the people of Italy as their slaves or\n",
      "their enemies. Her salutary measures were directed by the wisdom, and\n",
      "celebrated by the eloquence, of Cassiodorus; she solicited and deserved\n",
      "the friendship of the emperor; and the kingdoms of Europe respected,\n",
      "both in peace and war, the majesty of the Gothic throne. But the future\n",
      "happiness of the queen and of Italy depended on the education of her\n",
      "son; who was destined, by his birth, to support the different and almost\n",
      "incompatible characters of the chief of a Barbarian camp, and the first\n",
      "magistrate of a civilized nation. From the age of ten years, Athalaric\n",
      "was diligently instructed in the arts and sciences, either useful or\n",
      "ornamental for a Roman prince; and three venerable Goths were chosen to\n",
      "instil the principles of honor and virtue into the mind of their young\n",
      "king. But the pupil who is insensible of the benefits, must abhor\n",
      "the restraints, of education; and the solicitude of the queen, which\n",
      "affection rendered anxious and severe, offended the untractable nature\n",
      "of her son and his subjects. On a solemn festival, when the Goths were\n",
      "assembled in the palace of Ravenna, the royal youth escaped from his\n",
      "mother's apartment, and, with tears of pride and anger, complained of\n",
      "a blow which his stubborn disobedience had provoked her to inflict. The\n",
      "Barbarians resented the indignity which had been offered to their\n",
      "king; accused the regent of conspiring against his life and crown; and\n",
      "imperiously demanded, that the grandson of Theodoric should be rescued\n",
      "from the dastardly discipline of women and pedants, and educated, like a\n",
      "valiant Goth, in the society of his equals and the glorious ignorance of\n",
      "his ancestors. To this rude clamor, importunately urged as the voice\n",
      "of the nation, Amalasontha was compelled to yield her reason, and the\n",
      "dearest wishes of her heart. The king of Italy was abandoned to wine,\n",
      "to women, and to rustic sports; and the indiscreet contempt of the\n",
      "ungrateful youth betrayed the mischievous designs of his favorites and\n",
      "her enemies. Encompassed with domestic foes, she entered into a secret\n",
      "negotiation with the emperor Justinian; obtained the assurance of a\n",
      "friendly reception, and had actually deposited at Dyrachium, in Epirus,\n",
      "a treasure of forty thousand pounds of gold. Happy would it have been\n",
      "for her fame and safety, if she had calmly retired from barbarous\n",
      "faction to the peace and splendor of Constantinople. But the mind of\n",
      "Amalasontha was inflamed by ambition and revenge; and while her ships\n",
      "lay at anchor in the port, she waited for the success of a crime which\n",
      "her passions excused or applauded as an act of justice. Three of the\n",
      "most dangerous malecontents had been separately removed under the\n",
      "pretence of trust and command, to the frontiers of Italy: they were\n",
      "assassinated by her private emissaries; and the blood of these noble\n",
      "Goths rendered the queen-mother absolute in the court of Ravenna, and\n",
      "justly odious to a free people. But if she had lamented the disorders of\n",
      "her son she soon wept his irreparable loss; and the death of Athalaric,\n",
      "who, at the age of sixteen, was consumed by premature intemperance,\n",
      "left her destitute of any firm support or legal authority. Instead of\n",
      "submitting to the laws of her country which held as a fundamental maxim,\n",
      "that the succession could never pass from the lance to the distaff, the\n",
      "daughter of Theodoric conceived the impracticable design of sharing,\n",
      "with one of her cousins, the regal title, and of reserving in her own\n",
      "hands the substance of supreme power. He received the proposal with\n",
      "profound respect and affected gratitude; and the eloquent Cassiodorus\n",
      "announced to the senate and the emperor, that Amalasontha and Theodatus\n",
      "had ascended the throne of Italy. His birth (for his mother was the\n",
      "sister of Theodoric) might be considered as an imperfect title; and the\n",
      "choice of Amalasontha was more strongly directed by her contempt of\n",
      "his avarice and pusillanimity which had deprived him of the love of\n",
      "the Italians, and the esteem of the Barbarians. But Theodatus was\n",
      "exasperated by the contempt which he deserved: her justice had repressed\n",
      "and reproached the oppression which he exercised against his Tuscan\n",
      "neighbors; and the principal Goths, united by common guilt and\n",
      "resentment, conspired to instigate his slow and timid disposition. The\n",
      "letters of congratulation were scarcely despatched before the queen of\n",
      "Italy was imprisoned in a small island of the Lake of Bolsena, where,\n",
      "after a short confinement, she was strangled in the bath, by the order,\n",
      "or with the connivance of the new king, who instructed his turbulent\n",
      "subjects to shed the blood of their sovereigns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justinian beheld with joy the dissensions of the Goths; and the\n",
      "mediation of an ally concealed and promoted the ambitious views of\n",
      "the conqueror. His ambassadors, in their public audience, demanded the\n",
      "fortress of LilybÊum, ten Barbarian fugitives, and a just compensation\n",
      "for the pillage of a small town on the Illyrian borders; but they\n",
      "secretly negotiated with Theodatus to betray the province of Tuscany,\n",
      "and tempted Amalasontha to extricate herself from danger and perplexity,\n",
      "by a free surrender of the kingdom of Italy. A false and servile epistle\n",
      "was subscribed, by the reluctant hand of the captive queen: but the\n",
      "confession of the Roman senators, who were sent to Constantinople,\n",
      "revealed the truth of her deplorable situation; and Justinian, by the\n",
      "voice of a new ambassador, most powerfully interceded for her life and\n",
      "liberty. Yet the secret instructions of the same minister were adapted\n",
      "to serve the cruel jealousy of Theodora, who dreaded the presence and\n",
      "superior charms of a rival: he prompted, with artful and ambiguous\n",
      "hints, the execution of a crime so useful to the Romans; received the\n",
      "intelligence of her death with grief and indignation, and denounced,\n",
      "in his master's name, immortal war against the perfidious assassin. In\n",
      "Italy, as well as in Africa, the guilt of a usurper appeared to\n",
      "justify the arms of Justinian; but the forces which he prepared, were\n",
      "insufficient for the subversion of a mighty kingdom, if their feeble\n",
      "numbers had not been multiplied by the name, the spirit, and the\n",
      "conduct, of a hero. A chosen troop of guards, who served on horseback,\n",
      "and were armed with lances and bucklers, attended the person of\n",
      "Belisarius; his cavalry was composed of two hundred Huns, three hundred\n",
      "Moors, and four thousand _confederates_, and the infantry consisted of\n",
      "only three thousand Isaurians. Steering the same course as in his former\n",
      "expedition, the Roman consul cast anchor before Catana in Sicily, to\n",
      "survey the strength of the island, and to decide whether he should\n",
      "attempt the conquest, or peaceably pursue his voyage for the African\n",
      "coast. He found a fruitful land and a friendly people. Notwithstanding\n",
      "the decay of agriculture, Sicily still supplied the granaries of Rome:\n",
      "the farmers were graciously exempted from the oppression of military\n",
      "quarters; and the Goths, who trusted the defence of the island to the\n",
      "inhabitants, had some reason to complain, that their confidence was\n",
      "ungratefully betrayed. Instead of soliciting and expecting the aid\n",
      "of the king of Italy, they yielded to the first summons a cheerful\n",
      "obedience; and this province, the first fruits of the Punic war, was\n",
      "again, after a long separation, united to the Roman empire. The Gothic\n",
      "garrison of Palermo, which alone attempted to resist, was reduced, after\n",
      "a short siege, by a singular stratagem. Belisarius introduced his ships\n",
      "into the deepest recess of the harbor; their boats were laboriously\n",
      "hoisted with ropes and pulleys to the top-mast head, and he filled them\n",
      "with archers, who, from that superior station, commanded the ramparts\n",
      "of the city. After this easy, though successful campaign, the conqueror\n",
      "entered Syracuse in triumph, at the head of his victorious bands,\n",
      "distributing gold medals to the people, on the day which so gloriously\n",
      "terminated the year of the consulship. He passed the winter season in\n",
      "the palace of ancient kings, amidst the ruins of a Grecian colony, which\n",
      "once extended to a circumference of two-and-twenty miles: but in the\n",
      "spring, about the festival of Easter, the prosecution of his designs was\n",
      "interrupted by a dangerous revolt of the African forces. Carthage was\n",
      "saved by the presence of Belisarius, who suddenly landed with a thousand\n",
      "guards. Two thousand soldiers of doubtful faith returned to the\n",
      "standard of their old commander: and he marched, without hesitation,\n",
      "above fifty miles, to seek an enemy whom he affected to pity and\n",
      "despise. Eight thousand rebels trembled at his approach; they were\n",
      "routed at the first onset, by the dexterity of their master: and\n",
      "this ignoble victory would have restored the peace of Africa, if the\n",
      "conqueror had not been hastily recalled to Sicily, to appease a sedition\n",
      "which was kindled during his absence in his own camp. Disorder and\n",
      "disobedience were the common malady of the times; the genius to command,\n",
      "and the virtue to obey, resided only in the mind of Belisarius.\n",

      "writings of Plato and Tully, philosophy was incapable of purifying his\n",

      "their unworthy sovereign. Astonished by the recent example of Gelimer,\n",
      "he saw himself dragged in chains through the streets of Constantinople:\n",
      "the terrors which Belisarius inspired were heightened by the eloquence\n",
      "of Peter, the Byzantine ambassador; and that bold and subtle advocate\n",
      "persuaded him to sign a treaty, too ignominious to become the foundation\n",
      "of a lasting peace. It was stipulated, that in the acclamations of the\n",
      "Roman people, the name of the emperor should be always proclaimed before\n",

      "was erected in brass on marble, the divine image of Justinian should be\n",
      "placed on its right hand. Instead of conferring, the king of Italy was\n",
      "reduced to solicit, the honors of the senate; and the consent of the\n",
      "emperor was made indispensable before he could execute, against a priest\n",
      "or senator, the sentence either of death or confiscation. The feeble\n",
      "monarch resigned the possession of Sicily; offered, as the annual\n",
      "mark of his dependence, a crown of gold of the weight of three hundred\n",
      "pounds; and promised to supply, at the requisition of his sovereign,\n",
      "three thousand Gothic auxiliaries, for the service of the empire.\n",
      "Satisfied with these extraordinary concessions, the successful agent of\n",
      "Justinian hastened his journey to Constantinople; but no sooner had\n",
      "he reached the Alban villa, than he was recalled by the anxiety of\n",
      "Theodatus; and the dialogue which passed between the king and the\n",
      "ambassador deserves to be represented in its original simplicity. \"Are\n",
      "you of opinion that the emperor will ratify this treaty? _Perhaps_. If\n",
      "he refuses, what consequence will ensue? _War_. Will such a war, be just\n",
      "or reasonable? _Most assuredly: every one should act according to his\n",
      "character_. What is your meaning? _You are a philosopher--Justinian is\n",
      "emperor of the Romans: it would ill become the disciple of Plato to shed\n",
      "the blood of thousands in his private quarrel: the successor of Augustus\n",
      "should vindicate his rights, and recover by arms the ancient provinces\n",
      "of his empire_.\" This reasoning might not convince, but it was\n",
      "sufficient to alarm and subdue the weakness of Theodatus; and he soon\n",
      "descended to his last offer, that for the poor equivalent of a pension\n",
      "of forty-eight thousand pounds sterling, he would resign the kingdom\n",
      "of the Goths and Italians, and spend the remainder of his days in the\n",
      "innocent pleasures of philosophy and agriculture. Both treaties were\n",
      "intrusted to the hands of the ambassador, on the frail security of\n",
      "an oath not to produce the second till the first had been positively\n",
      "rejected. The event may be easily foreseen: Justinian required and\n",
      "accepted the abdication of the Gothic king. His indefatigable agent\n",
      "returned from Constantinople to Ravenna, with ample instructions; and\n",
      "a fair epistle, which praised the wisdom and generosity of the royal\n",
      "philosopher, granted his pension, with the assurance of such honors as\n",
      "a subject and a Catholic might enjoy; and wisely referred the final\n",
      "execution of the treaty to the presence and authority of Belisarius.\n",
      "But in the interval of suspense, two Roman generals, who had entered the\n",
      "province of Dalmatia, were defeated and slain by the Gothic troops. From\n",
      "blind and abject despair, Theodatus capriciously rose to groundless and\n",
      "fatal presumption, and dared to receive, with menace and contempt,\n",
      "the ambassador of Justinian; who claimed his promise, solicited the\n",
      "allegiance of his subjects, and boldly asserted the inviolable privilege\n",
      "of his own character. The march of Belisarius dispelled this visionary\n",
      "pride; and as the first campaign was employed in the reduction of\n",
      "Sicily, the invasion of Italy is applied by Procopius to the second year\n",
      "of the Gothic war.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Belisarius had left sufficient garrisons in Palermo and Syracuse,\n",
      "he embarked his troops at Messina, and landed them, without resistance,\n",
      "on the opposite shores of Rhegium. A Gothic prince, who had married the\n",
      "daughter of Theodatus, was stationed with an army to guard the entrance\n",
      "of Italy; but he imitated, without scruple, the example of a sovereign\n",
      "faithless to his public and private duties. The perfidious Ebermor\n",
      "deserted with his followers to the Roman camp, and was dismissed to\n",
      "enjoy the servile honors of the Byzantine court. From Rhegium to Naples,\n",
      "the fleet and army of Belisarius, almost always in view of each other,\n",
      "advanced near three hundred miles along the sea-coast. The people of\n",
      "Bruttium, Lucania, and Campania, who abhorred the name and religion of\n",
      "the Goths, embraced the specious excuse, that their ruined walls\n",
      "were incapable of defence: the soldiers paid a just equivalent for\n",
      "a plentiful market; and curiosity alone interrupted the peaceful\n",
      "occupations of the husbandman or artificer. Naples, which has swelled to\n",
      "a great and populous capital, long cherished the language and manners\n",
      "of a Grecian colony; and the choice of Virgil had ennobled this elegant\n",
      "retreat, which attracted the lovers of repose and study, elegant\n",
      "retreat, which attracted the lovers of repose and study, from the noise,\n",
      "the smoke, and the laborious opulence of Rome. As soon as the place was\n",
      "invested by sea and land, Belisarius gave audience to the deputies of\n",
      "the people, who exhorted him to disregard a conquest unworthy of his\n",
      "arms, to seek the Gothic king in a field of battle, and, after his\n",
      "victory, to claim, as the sovereign of Rome, the allegiance of the\n",
      "dependent cities. \"When I treat with my enemies,\" replied the Roman\n",
      "chief, with a haughty smile, \"I am more accustomed to give than to\n",
      "receive counsel; but I hold in one hand inevitable ruin, and in the\n",
      "other peace and freedom, such as Sicily now enjoys.\" The impatience of\n",
      "delay urged him to grant the most liberal terms; his honor secured their\n",
      "performance: but Naples was divided into two factions; and the Greek\n",
      "democracy was inflamed by their orators, who, with much spirit and some\n",
      "truth, represented to the multitude that the Goths would punish their\n",
      "defection, and that Belisarius himself must esteem their loyalty and\n",
      "valor. Their deliberations, however, were not perfectly free: the city\n",
      "was commanded by eight hundred Barbarians, whose wives and children were\n",
      "detained at Ravenna as the pledge of their fidelity; and even the Jews,\n",
      "who were rich and numerous, resisted, with desperate enthusiasm, the\n",
      "intolerant laws of Justinian. In a much later period, the circumference\n",
      "of Naples measured only two thousand three hundred and sixty three\n",
      "paces: the fortifications were defended by precipices or the sea; when\n",
      "the aqueducts were intercepted, a supply of water might be drawn from\n",
      "wells and fountains; and the stock of provisions was sufficient to\n",
      "consume the patience of the besiegers. At the end of twenty days, that\n",
      "of Belisarius was almost exhausted, and he had reconciled himself to the\n",
      "disgrace of abandoning the siege, that he might march, before the winter\n",
      "season, against Rome and the Gothic king. But his anxiety was relieved\n",
      "by the bold curiosity of an Isaurian, who explored the dry channel of an\n",
      "aqueduct, and secretly reported, that a passage might be perforated to\n",
      "introduce a file of armed soldiers into the heart of the city. When the\n",
      "work had been silently executed, the humane general risked the discovery\n",
      "of his secret by a last and fruitless admonition of the impending\n",
      "danger. In the darkness of the night, four hundred Romans entered\n",
      "the aqueduct, raised themselves by a rope, which they fastened to an\n",
      "olive-tree, into the house or garden of a solitary matron, sounded\n",
      "their trumpets, surprised the sentinels, and gave admittance to their\n",
      "companions, who on all sides scaled the walls, and burst open the\n",
      "gates of the city. Every crime which is punished by social justice was\n",
      "practised as the rights of war; the Huns were distinguished by cruelty\n",
      "and sacrilege, and Belisarius alone appeared in the streets and churches\n",
      "of Naples to moderate the calamities which he predicted. \"The gold and\n",
      "silver,\" he repeatedly exclaimed, \"are the just rewards of your valor.\n",
      "But spare the inhabitants; they are Christians, they are suppliants,\n",
      "they are now your fellow-subjects. Restore the children to their\n",
      "parents, the wives to their husbands; and show them by you, generosity\n",
      "of what friends they have obstinately deprived themselves.\" The city\n",
      "was saved by the virtue and authority of its conqueror; and when the\n",
      "Neapolitans returned to their houses, they found some consolation in\n",
      "the secret enjoyment of their hidden treasures. The Barbarian garrison\n",
      "enlisted in the service of the emperor; Apulia and Calabria, delivered\n",
      "from the odious presence of the Goths, acknowledged his dominion; and\n",
      "the tusks of the Calydonian boar, which were still shown at Beneventum,\n",
      "are curiously described by the historian of Belisarius.\n",
      "\n",
      "The faithful soldiers and citizens of Naples had expected their\n",
      "deliverance from a prince, who remained the inactive and almost\n",
      "indifferent spectator of their ruin. Theodatus secured his person within\n",
      "the walls of Rome, whilst his cavalry advanced forty miles on the Appian\n",
      "way, and encamped in the Pomptine marshes; which, by a canal of nineteen\n",
      "miles in length, had been recently drained and converted into excellent\n",
      "pastures. But the principal forces of the Goths were dispersed in\n",
      "Dalmatia, Venetia, and Gaul; and the feeble mind of their king was\n",
      "confounded by the unsuccessful event of a divination, which seemed\n",
      "to presage the downfall of his empire. The most abject slaves have\n",
      "arraigned the guilt or weakness of an unfortunate master. The character\n",
      "of Theodatus was rigorously scrutinized by a free and idle camp of\n",
      "Barbarians, conscious of their privilege and power: he was declared\n",
      "unworthy of his race, his nation, and his throne; and their general\n",
      "Vitiges, whose valor had been signalized in the Illyrian war, was raised\n",
      "with unanimous applause on the bucklers of his companions. On the first\n",
      "rumor, the abdicated monarch fled from the justice of his country; but\n",
      "he was pursued by private revenge. A Goth, whom he had injured in his\n",
      "love, overtook Theodatus on the Flaminian way, and, regardless of his\n",
      "unmanly cries, slaughtered him, as he lay, prostrate on the ground, like\n",
      "a victim (says the historian) at the foot of the altar. The choice of\n",
      "the people is the best and purest title to reign over them; yet such is\n",
      "the prejudice of every age, that Vitiges impatiently wished to return to\n",
      "Ravenna, where he might seize, with the reluctant hand of the daughter\n",
      "of Amalasontha, some faint shadow of hereditary right. A national\n",
      "council was immediately held, and the new monarch reconciled the\n",
      "impatient spirit of the Barbarians to a measure of disgrace, which the\n",
      "misconduct of his predecessor rendered wise and indispensable. The Goths\n",
      "consented to retreat in the presence of a victorious enemy; to delay\n",
      "till the next spring the operations of offensive war; to summon their\n",
      "scattered forces; to relinquish their distant possessions, and to trust\n",
      "even Rome itself to the faith of its inhabitants. Leuderis, an ancient\n",
      "warrior, was left in the capital with four thousand soldiers; a feeble\n",
      "garrison, which might have seconded the zeal, though it was incapable\n",
      "of opposing the wishes, of the Romans. But a momentary enthusiasm of\n",
      "religion and patriotism was kindled in their minds. They furiously\n",
      "exclaimed, that the apostolic throne should no longer be profaned by the\n",
      "triumph or toleration of Arianism; that the tombs of the CÊsars\n",
      "should no longer be trampled by the savages of the North; and, without\n",
      "reflecting, that Italy must sink into a province of Constantinople, they\n",
      "fondly hailed the restoration of a Roman emperor as a new Êra of freedom\n",
      "and prosperity. The deputies of the pope and clergy, of the senate and\n",
      "people, invited the lieutenant of Justinian to accept their voluntary\n",
      "allegiance, and to enter the city, whose gates would be thrown open for\n",
      "his reception. As soon as Belisarius had fortified his new conquests,\n",
      "Naples and CumÊ, he advanced about twenty miles to the banks of the\n",
      "Vulturnus, contemplated the decayed grandeur of Capua, and halted at the\n",
      "separation of the Latin and Appian ways. The work of the censor, after\n",
      "the incessant use of nine centuries, still preserved its primÊval\n",
      "beauty, and not a flaw could be discovered in the large polished stones,\n",
      "of which that solid, though narrow road, was so firmly compacted.\n",
      "Belisarius, however, preferred the Latin way, which, at a distance from\n",
      "the sea and the marshes, skirted in a space of one hundred and twenty\n",
      "miles along the foot of the mountains. His enemies had disappeared: when\n",
      "he made his entrance through the Asinarian gate, the garrison departed\n",
      "without molestation along the Flaminian way; and the city, after\n",
      "sixty years' servitude, was delivered from the yoke of the Barbarians.\n",
      "Leuderis alone, from a motive of pride or discontent, refused to\n",
      "accompany the fugitives; and the Gothic chief, himself a trophy of the\n",
      "victory, was sent with the keys of Rome to the throne of the emperor\n",
      "Justinian.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first days, which coincided with the old Saturnalia, were devoted to\n",
      "mutual congratulation and the public joy; and the Catholics prepared to\n",
      "celebrate, without a rival, the approaching festival of the nativity of\n",
      "Christ. In the familiar conversation of a hero, the Romans acquired some\n",
      "notion of the virtues which history ascribed to their ancestors; they\n",
      "were edified by the apparent respect of Belisarius for the successor\n",
      "of St. Peter, and his rigid discipline secured in the midst of war the\n",
      "blessings of tranquillity and justice. They applauded the rapid success\n",
      "of his arms, which overran the adjacent country, as far as Narni,\n",
      "Perusia, and Spoleto; but they trembled, the senate, the clergy, and the\n",
      "unwarlike people, as soon as they understood that he had resolved, and\n",
      "would speedily be reduced, to sustain a siege against the powers of the\n",
      "Gothic monarchy. The designs of Vitiges were executed, during the winter\n",
      "season, with diligence and effect. From their rustic habitations, from\n",
      "their distant garrisons, the Goths assembled at Ravenna for the defence\n",
      "of their country; and such were their numbers, that, after an army had\n",
      "been detached for the relief of Dalmatia, one hundred and fifty thousand\n",
      "fighting men marched under the royal standard. According to the degrees\n",
      "of rank or merit, the Gothic king distributed arms and horses, rich\n",
      "gifts, and liberal promises; he moved along the Flaminian way, declined\n",
      "the useless sieges of Perusia and Spoleto, respected he impregnable\n",
      "rock of Narni, and arrived within two miles of Rome at the foot of\n",
      "the Milvian bridge. The narrow passage was fortified with a tower, and\n",
      "Belisarius had computed the value of the twenty days which must be lost\n",
      "in the construction of another bridge. But the consternation of the\n",
      "soldiers of the tower, who either fled or deserted, disappointed his\n",
      "hopes, and betrayed his person into the most imminent danger. At the\n",
      "head of one thousand horse, the Roman general sallied from the Flaminian\n",
      "gate to mark the ground of an advantageous position, and to survey the\n",
      "camp of the Barbarians; but while he still believed them on the other\n",
      "side of the Tyber, he was suddenly encompassed and assaulted by their\n",
      "numerous squadrons. The fate of Italy depended on his life; and the\n",
      "deserters pointed to the conspicuous horse a bay, with a white face,\n",
      "which he rode on that memorable day. \"Aim at the bay horse,\" was the\n",
      "universal cry. Every bow was bent, every javelin was directed, against\n",
      "that fatal object, and the command was repeated and obeyed by thousands\n",
      "who were ignorant of its real motive. The bolder Barbarians advanced\n",
      "to the more honorable combat of swords and spears; and the praise of\n",
      "an enemy has graced the fall of Visandus, the standard-bearer, who\n",
      "maintained his foremost station, till he was pierced with thirteen\n",
      "wounds, perhaps by the hand of Belisarius himself. The Roman general was\n",
      "strong, active, and dexterous; on every side he discharged his weighty\n",
      "and mortal strokes: his faithful guards imitated his valor, and defended\n",
      "his person; and the Goths, after the loss of a thousand men, fled before\n",
      "the arms of a hero. They were rashly pursued to their camp; and the\n",
      "Romans, oppressed by multitudes, made a gradual, and at length a\n",
      "precipitate retreat to the gates of the city: the gates were shut\n",
      "against the fugitives; and the public terror was increased, by the\n",
      "report that Belisarius was slain. His countenance was indeed disfigured\n",
      "by sweat, dust, and blood; his voice was hoarse, his strength was almost\n",
      "exhausted; but his unconquerable spirit still remained; he imparted that\n",
      "spirit to his desponding companions; and their last desperate charge was\n",
      "felt by the flying Barbarians, as if a new army, vigorous and entire,\n",
      "had been poured from the city. The Flaminian gate was thrown open to a\n",
      "real triumph; but it was not before Belisarius had visited every post,\n",
      "and provided for the public safety, that he could be persuaded, by his\n",
      "wife and friends, to taste the needful refreshments of food and sleep.\n",
      "In the more improved state of the art of war, a general is seldom\n",
      "required, or even permitted to display the personal prowess of a\n",
      "soldier; and the example of Belisarius may be added to the rare examples\n",
      "of Henry IV., of Pyrrhus, and of Alexander.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this first and unsuccessful trial of their enemies, the whole army\n",
      "of the Goths passed the Tyber, and formed the siege of the city, which\n",
      "continued above a year, till their final departure. Whatever fancy may\n",
      "conceive, the severe compass of the geographer defines the circumference\n",
      "of Rome within a line of twelve miles and three hundred and forty-five\n",
      "paces; and that circumference, except in the Vatican, has invariably\n",
      "been the same from the triumph of Aurelian to the peaceful but obscure\n",
      "reign of the modern popes. But in the day of her greatness, the space\n",
      "within her walls was crowded with habitations and inhabitants; and the\n",
      "populous suburbs, that stretched along the public roads, were darted\n",
      "like so many rays from one common centre. Adversity swept away these\n",
      "extraneous ornaments, and left naked and desolate a considerable part\n",
      "even of the seven hills. Yet Rome in its present state could send\n",
      "into the field about thirty thousand males of a military age; and,\n",
      "notwithstanding the want of discipline and exercise, the far greater\n",
      "part, inured to the hardships of poverty, might be capable of bearing\n",
      "arms for the defence of their country and religion. The prudence of\n",
      "Belisarius did not neglect this important resource. His soldiers were\n",
      "relieved by the zeal and diligence of the people, who watched while\n",
      "_they_ slept, and labored while _they_ reposed: he accepted the\n",
      "voluntary service of the bravest and most indigent of the Roman youth;\n",
      "and the companies of townsmen sometimes represented, in a vacant post,\n",
      "the presence of the troops which had been drawn away to more essential\n",
      "duties. But his just confidence was placed in the veterans who had\n",
      "fought under his banner in the Persian and African wars; and although\n",
      "that gallant band was reduced to five thousand men, he undertook, with\n",
      "such contemptible numbers, to defend a circle of twelve miles, against\n",
      "an army of one hundred and fifty thousand Barbarians. In the walls of\n",
      "Rome, which Belisarius constructed or restored, the materials of\n",
      "ancient architecture may be discerned; and the whole fortification\n",
      "was completed, except in a chasm still extant between the Pincian and\n",
      "Flaminian gates, which the prejudices of the Goths and Romans left under\n",
      "the effectual guard of St. Peter the apostle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The battlements or bastions were shaped in sharp angles a ditch, broad\n",
      "and deep, protected the foot of the rampart; and the archers on the\n",
      "rampart were assisted by military engines; the _balista_, a powerful\n",
      "cross-bow, which darted short but massy arrows; the _onagri_, or wild\n",
      "asses, which, on the principle of a sling, threw stones and bullets of\n",
      "an enormous size. A chain was drawn across the Tyber; the arches of the\n",
      "aqueducts were made impervious, and the mole or sepulchre of Hadrian was\n",
      "converted, for the first time, to the uses of a citadel. That venerable\n",
      "structure, which contained the ashes of the Antonines, was a circular\n",
      "turret rising from a quadrangular basis; it was covered with the white\n",
      "marble of Paros, and decorated by the statues of gods and heroes;\n",
      "and the lover of the arts must read with a sigh, that the works of\n",
      "Praxiteles or Lysippus were torn from their lofty pedestals, and hurled\n",
      "into the ditch on the heads of the besiegers. To each of his lieutenants\n",
      "Belisarius assigned the defence of a gate, with the wise and peremptory\n",
      "instruction, that, whatever might be the alarm, they should steadily\n",
      "adhere to their respective posts, and trust their general for the safety\n",
      "of Rome. The formidable host of the Goths was insufficient to embrace\n",
      "the ample measure of the city, of the fourteen gates, seven only were\n",
      "invested from the Prnestine to the Flaminian way; and Vitiges divided\n",
      "his troops into six camps, each of which was fortified with a ditch\n",
      "and rampart. On the Tuscan side of the river, a seventh encampment was\n",
      "formed in the field or circus of the Vatican, for the important purpose\n",
      "of commanding the Milvian bridge and the course of the Tyber; but they\n",
      "approached with devotion the adjacent church of St. Peter; and the\n",
      "threshold of the holy apostles was respected during the siege by a\n",
      "Christian enemy. In the ages of victory, as often as the senate decreed\n",
      "some distant conquest, the consul denounced hostilities, by unbarring,\n",
      "in solemn pomp, the gates of the temple of Janus. Domestic war now\n",
      "rendered the admonition superfluous, and the ceremony was superseded by\n",
      "the establishment of a new religion. But the brazen temple of Janus was\n",
      "left standing in the forum; of a size sufficient only to contain the\n",
      "statue of the god, five cubits in height, of a human form, but with two\n",
      "faces directed to the east and west. The double gates were likewise\n",
      "of brass; and a fruitless effort to turn them on their rusty hinges\n",
      "revealed the scandalous secret that some Romans were still attached to\n",
      "the superstition of their ancestors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eighteen days were employed by the besiegers, to provide all the\n",
      "instruments of attack which antiquity had invented. Fascines were\n",
      "prepared to fill the ditches, scaling-ladders to ascend the walls. The\n",
      "largest trees of the forest supplied the timbers of four battering-rams:\n",
      "their heads were armed with iron; they were suspended by ropes, and each\n",
      "of them was worked by the labor of fifty men. The lofty wooden turrets\n",
      "moved on wheels or rollers, and formed a spacious platform of the level\n",
      "of the rampart. On the morning of the nineteenth day, a general attack\n",
      "was made from the PrÊnestine gate to the Vatican: seven Gothic columns,\n",
      "with their military engines, advanced to the assault; and the Romans,\n",
      "who lined the ramparts, listened with doubt and anxiety to the cheerful\n",
      "assurances of their commander. As soon as the enemy approached the\n",
      "ditch, Belisarius himself drew the first arrow; and such was his\n",
      "strength and dexterity, that he transfixed the foremost of the Barbarian\n",
      "leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "As shout of applause and victory was reÎchoed along the wall. He drew a\n",
      "second arrow, and the stroke was followed with the same success and the\n",
      "same acclamation. The Roman general then gave the word, that the archers\n",
      "should aim at the teams of oxen; they were instantly covered with mortal\n",
      "wounds; the towers which they drew remained useless and immovable, and\n",
      "a single moment disconcerted the laborious projects of the king of the\n",
      "Goths. After this disappointment, Vitiges still continued, or feigned\n",
      "to continue, the assault of the Salarian gate, that he might divert the\n",
      "attention of his adversary, while his principal forces more strenuously\n",
      "attacked the PrÊnestine gate and the sepulchre of Hadrian, at the\n",
      "distance of three miles from each other. Near the former, the double\n",
      "walls of the Vivarium were low or broken; the fortifications of the\n",
      "latter were feebly guarded: the vigor of the Goths was excited by the\n",
      "hope of victory and spoil; and if a single post had given way, the\n",
      "Romans, and Rome itself, were irrecoverably lost. This perilous day was\n",
      "the most glorious in the life of Belisarius. Amidst tumult and dismay,\n",
      "the whole plan of the attack and defence was distinctly present to his\n",
      "mind; he observed the changes of each instant, weighed every possible\n",
      "advantage, transported his person to the scenes of danger, and\n",
      "communicated his spirit in calm and decisive orders. The contest was\n",
      "fiercely maintained from the morning to the evening; the Goths were\n",
      "repulsed on all sides; and each Roman might boast that he had vanquished\n",
      "thirty Barbarians, if the strange disproportion of numbers were\n",
      "not counterbalanced by the merit of one man. Thirty thousand Goths,\n",
      "according to the confession of their own chiefs, perished in this bloody\n",
      "action; and the multitude of the wounded was equal to that of the slain.\n",
      "When they advanced to the assault, their close disorder suffered not a\n",
      "javelin to fall without effect; and as they retired, the populace of the\n",
      "city joined the pursuit, and slaughtered, with impunity, the backs of\n",
      "their flying enemies. Belisarius instantly sallied from the gates; and\n",
      "while the soldiers chanted his name and victory, the hostile engines of\n",
      "war were reduced to ashes. Such was the loss and consternation of the\n",
      "Goths, that, from this day, the siege of Rome degenerated into a tedious\n",
      "and indolent blockade; and they were incessantly harassed by the Roman\n",
      "general, who, in frequent skirmishes, destroyed above five thousand of\n",
      "their bravest troops. Their cavalry was unpractised in the use of the\n",
      "bow; their archers served on foot; and this divided force was incapable\n",
      "of contending with their adversaries, whose lances and arrows, at a\n",
      "distance, or at hand, were alike formidable. The consummate skill of\n",
      "Belisarius embraced the favorable opportunities; and as he chose the\n",
      "ground and the moment, as he pressed the charge or sounded the retreat,\n",
      "the squadrons which he detached were seldom unsuccessful. These partial\n",
      "advantages diffused an impatient ardor among the soldiers and people,\n",
      "who began to feel the hardships of a siege, and to disregard the dangers\n",
      "of a general engagement. Each plebeian conceived himself to be a hero,\n",
      "and the infantry, who, since the decay of discipline, were rejected from\n",
      "the line of battle, aspired to the ancient honors of the Roman\n",
      "legion. Belisarius praised the spirit of his troops, condemned their\n",
      "presumption, yielded to their clamors, and prepared the remedies of a\n",
      "defeat, the possibility of which he alone had courage to suspect. In\n",
      "the quarter of the Vatican, the Romans prevailed; and if the irreparable\n",
      "moments had not been wasted in the pillage of the camp, they might have\n",
      "occupied the Milvian bridge, and charged in the rear of the Gothic host.\n",
      "On the other side of the Tyber, Belisarius advanced from the Pincian and\n",
      "Salarian gates. But his army, four thousand soldiers perhaps, was\n",
      "lost in a spacious plain; they were encompassed and oppressed by fresh\n",
      "multitudes, who continually relieved the broken ranks of the Barbarians.\n",
      "The valiant leaders of the infantry were unskilled to conquer; they\n",
      "died: the retreat (a hasty retreat) was covered by the prudence of the\n",
      "general, and the victors started back with affright from the formidable\n",
      "aspect of an armed rampart. The reputation of Belisarius was unsullied\n",
      "by a defeat; and the vain confidence of the Goths was not less\n",
      "serviceable to his designs than the repentance and modesty of the Roman\n",
      "troops.\n",

      "From the moment that Belisarius had determined to sustain a siege, his\n",
      "assiduous care provided Rome against the danger of famine, more dreadful\n",
      "than the Gothic arms. An extraordinary supply of corn was imported from\n",
      "Sicily: the harvests of Campania and Tuscany were forcibly swept for the\n",
      "use of the city; and the rights of private property were infringed by\n",
      "the strong plea of the public safety. It might easily be foreseen\n",
      "that the enemy would intercept the aqueducts; and the cessation of the\n",
      "water-mills was the first inconvenience, which was speedily removed\n",
      "by mooring large vessels, and fixing mill-stones in the current of\n",
      "the river. The stream was soon embarrassed by the trunks of trees, and\n",
      "polluted with dead bodies; yet so effectual were the precautions of\n",
      "the Roman general, that the waters of the Tyber still continued to\n",
      "give motion to the mills and drink to the inhabitants: the more distant\n",
      "quarters were supplied from domestic wells; and a besieged city might\n",
      "support, without impatience, the privation of her public baths. A large\n",
      "portion of Rome, from the PrÊnestine gate to the church of St. Paul,\n",
      "was never invested by the Goths; their excursions were restrained by\n",
      "the activity of the Moorish troops: the navigation of the Tyber, and the\n",
      "Latin, Appian, and Ostian ways, were left free and unmolested for the\n",
      "introduction of corn and cattle, or the retreat of the inhabitants, who\n",
      "sought refuge in Campania or Sicily. Anxious to relieve himself from a\n",
      "useless and devouring multitude, Belisarius issued his peremptory\n",
      "orders for the instant departure of the women, the children, and slaves;\n",
      "required his soldiers to dismiss their male and female attendants, and\n",
      "regulated their allowance that one moiety should be given in provisions,\n",
      "and the other in money. His foresight was justified by the increase of\n",
      "the public distress, as soon as the Goths had occupied two important\n",
      "posts in the neighborhood of Rome. By the loss of the port, or, as it\n",
      "is now called, the city of Porto, he was deprived of the country on\n",
      "the right of the Tyber, and the best communication with the sea; and he\n",
      "reflected, with grief and anger, that three hundred men, could he have\n",
      "spared such a feeble band, might have defended its impregnable works.\n",
      "Seven miles from the capital, between the Appian and the Latin ways, two\n",
      "principal aqueducts crossing, and again crossing each other: enclosed\n",
      "within their solid and lofty arches a fortified space, where Vitiges\n",
      "established a camp of seven thousand Goths to intercept the convoy of\n",
      "Sicily and Campania. The granaries of Rome were insensibly exhausted,\n",
      "the adjacent country had been wasted with fire and sword; such scanty\n",
      "supplies as might yet be obtained by hasty excursions were the reward\n",
      "of valor, and the purchase of wealth: the forage of the horses, and\n",
      "the bread of the soldiers, never failed: but in the last months of the\n",
      "siege, the people were exposed to the miseries of scarcity, unwholesome\n",
      "food, and contagious disorders. Belisarius saw and pitied their\n",
      "sufferings; but he had foreseen, and he watched the decay of their\n",
      "loyalty, and the progress of their discontent. Adversity had awakened\n",
      "the Romans from the dreams of grandeur and freedom, and taught them the\n",
      "humiliating lesson, that it was of small moment to their real happiness,\n",
      "whether the name of their master was derived from the Gothic or the\n",
      "Latin language. The lieutenant of Justinian listened to their just\n",
      "complaints, but he rejected with disdain the idea of flight or\n",
      "capitulation; repressed their clamorous impatience for battle; amused\n",
      "them with the prospect of a sure and speedy relief; and secured himself\n",
      "and the city from the effects of their despair or treachery. Twice in\n",
      "each month he changed the station of the officers to whom the custody\n",
      "of the gates was committed: the various precautions of patroles, watch\n",
      "words, lights, and music, were repeatedly employed to discover whatever\n",
      "passed on the ramparts; out-guards were posted beyond the ditch, and the\n",
      "trusty vigilance of dogs supplied the more doubtful fidelity of mankind.\n",
      "A letter was intercepted, which assured the king of the Goths that the\n",
      "Asinarian gate, adjoining to the Lateran church, should be secretly\n",
      "opened to his troops. On the proof or suspicion of treason, several\n",
      "senators were banished, and the pope Sylverius was summoned to attend\n",
      "the representative of his sovereign, at his head-quarters in the Pincian\n",
      "palace. The ecclesiastics, who followed their bishop, were detained in\n",
      "the first or second apartment, and he alone was admitted to the presence\n",
      "of Belisarius. The conqueror of Rome and Carthage was modestly seated at\n",
      "the feet of Antonina, who reclined on a stately couch: the general was\n",
      "silent, but the voice of reproach and menace issued from the mouth of\n",
      "his imperious wife. Accused by credible witnesses, and the evidence of\n",
      "his own subscription, the successor of St. Peter was despoiled of his\n",
      "pontifical ornaments, clad in the mean habit of a monk, and embarked,\n",
      "without delay, for a distant exile in the East. At the emperor's\n",
      "command, the clergy of Rome proceeded to the choice of a new bishop;\n",
      "and after a solemn invocation of the Holy Ghost, elected the deacon\n",
      "Vigilius, who had purchased the papal throne by a bribe of two hundred\n",
      "pounds of gold. The profit, and consequently the guilt, of this simony,\n",
      "was imputed to Belisarius: but the hero obeyed the orders of his wife;\n",
      "Antonina served the passions of the empress; and Theodora lavished\n",
      "her treasures, in the vain hope of obtaining a pontiff hostile or\n",
      "indifferent to the council of Chalcedon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The epistle of Belisarius to the emperor announced his victory, his\n",
      "danger, and his resolution. \"According to your commands, we have entered\n",
      "the dominions of the Goths, and reduced to your obedience Sicily,\n",
      "Campania, and the city of Rome; but the loss of these conquests will be\n",
      "more disgraceful than their acquisition was glorious. Hitherto we have\n",
      "successfully fought against the multitudes of the Barbarians, but their\n",
      "multitudes may finally prevail. Victory is the gift of Providence,\n",
      "but the reputation of kings and generals depends on the success or the\n",
      "failure of their designs. Permit me to speak with freedom: if you wish\n",
      "that we should live, send us subsistence; if you desire that we should\n",
      "conquer, send us arms, horses, and men. The Romans have received us\n",
      "as friends and deliverers: but in our present distress, _they_ will be\n",
      "either betrayed by their confidence, or we shall be oppressed by\n",
      "_their_ treachery and hatred. For myself, my life is consecrated to your\n",
      "service: it is yours to reflect, whether my death in this situation\n",
      "will contribute to the glory and prosperity of your reign.\" Perhaps that\n",
      "reign would have been equally prosperous if the peaceful master of\n",
      "the East had abstained from the conquest of Africa and Italy: but as\n",
      "Justinian was ambitious of fame, he made some efforts (they were\n",
      "feeble and languid) to support and rescue his victorious general. A\n",
      "reÎnforcement of sixteen hundred Sclavonians and Huns was led by Martin\n",
      "and Valerian; and as they reposed during the winter season in the\n",
      "harbors of Greece, the strength of the men and horses was not impaired\n",
      "by the fatigues of a sea-voyage; and they distinguished their valor\n",
      "in the first sally against the besiegers. About the time of the summer\n",
      "solstice, Euthalius landed at Terracina with large sums of money for the\n",
      "payment of the troops: he cautiously proceeded along the Appian way, and\n",
      "this convoy entered Rome through the gate Capena, while Belisarius, on\n",
      "the other side, diverted the attention of the Goths by a vigorous and\n",
      "successful skirmish. These seasonable aids, the use and reputation\n",
      "of which were dexterously managed by the Roman general, revived\n",
      "the courage, or at least the hopes, of the soldiers and people. The\n",
      "historian Procopius was despatched with an important commission to\n",
      "collect the troops and provisions which Campania could furnish, or\n",
      "Constantinople had sent; and the secretary of Belisarius was soon\n",
      "followed by Antonina herself, who boldly traversed the posts of the\n",
      "enemy, and returned with the Oriental succors to the relief of her\n",
      "husband and the besieged city. A fleet of three thousand Isaurians cast\n",
      "anchor in the Bay of Naples and afterwards at Ostia. Above two thousand\n",
      "horse, of whom a part were Thracians, landed at Tarentum; and, after\n",
      "the junction of five hundred soldiers of Campania, and a train of wagons\n",
      "laden with wine and flour, they directed their march on the Appian way,\n",
      "from Capua to the neighborhood of Rome. The forces that arrived by\n",
      "land and sea were united at the mouth of the Tyber. Antonina convened\n",
      "a council of war: it was resolved to surmount, with sails and oars,\n",
      "the adverse stream of the river; and the Goths were apprehensive of\n",
      "disturbing, by any rash hostilities, the negotiation to which Belisarius\n",
      "had craftily listened. They credulously believed that they saw no more\n",
      "than the vanguard of a fleet and army, which already covered the Ionian\n",
      "Sea and the plains of Campania; and the illusion was supported by the\n",
      "haughty language of the Roman general, when he gave audience to the\n",
      "ambassadors of Vitiges. After a specious discourse to vindicate the\n",
      "justice of his cause, they declared, that, for the sake of peace, they\n",
      "were disposed to renounce the possession of Sicily. \"The emperor is not\n",
      "less generous,\" replied his lieutenant, with a disdainful smile, \"in\n",
      "return for a gift which you no longer possess: he presents you with an\n",
      "ancient province of the empire; he resigns to the Goths the sovereignty\n",
      "of the British island.\" Belisarius rejected with equal firmness and\n",
      "contempt the offer of a tribute; but he allowed the Gothic ambassadors\n",
      "to seek their fate from the mouth of Justinian himself; and consented,\n",
      "with seeming reluctance, to a truce of three months, from the winter\n",
      "solstice to the equinox of spring. Prudence might not safely trust\n",
      "either the oaths or hostages of the Barbarians, and the conscious\n",
      "superiority of the Roman chief was expressed in the distribution of his\n",
      "troops. As soon as fear or hunger compelled the Goths to evacuate\n",
      "Alba, Porto, and CentumcellÊ, their place was instantly supplied; the\n",
      "garrisons of Narni, Spoleto, and Perusia, were reÎnforced, and the seven\n",
      "camps of the besiegers were gradually encompassed with the calamities of\n",
      "a siege. The prayers and pilgrimage of Datius, bishop of Milan, were not\n",
      "without effect; and he obtained one thousand Thracians and Isaurians, to\n",
      "assist the revolt of Liguria against her Arian tyrant. At the same\n",
      "time, John the Sanguinary, the nephew of Vitalian, was detached with two\n",
      "thousand chosen horse, first to Alba, on the Fucine Lake, and afterwards\n",
      "to the frontiers of Picenum, on the Hadriatic Sea. \"In the province,\"\n",
      "said Belisarius, \"the Goths have deposited their families and treasures,\n",
      "without a guard or the suspicion of danger. Doubtless they will violate\n",
      "the truce: let them feel your presence, before they hear of your\n",
      "motions. Spare the Italians; suffer not any fortified places to remain\n",
      "hostile in your rear; and faithfully reserve the spoil for an equal and\n",
      "common partition. It would not be reasonable,\" he added with a laugh,\n",
      "\"that whilst we are toiling to the destruction of the drones, our more\n",
      "fortunate brethren should rifle and enjoy the honey.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole nation of the Ostrogoths had been assembled for the attack,\n",
      "and was almost entirely consumed in the siege of Rome. If any credit be\n",
      "due to an intelligent spectator, one third at least of their enormous\n",
      "host was destroyed, in frequent and bloody combats under the walls of\n",
      "the city. The bad fame and pernicious qualities of the summer air might\n",
      "already be imputed to the decay of agriculture and population; and\n",
      "the evils of famine and pestilence were aggravated by their own\n",
      "licentiousness, and the unfriendly disposition of the country. While\n",
      "Vitiges struggled with his fortune, while he hesitated between shame and\n",
      "ruin, his retreat was hastened by domestic alarms. The king of the Goths\n",
      "was informed by trembling messengers, that John the Sanguinary spread\n",
      "the devastations of war from the Apennine to the Hadriatic; that the\n",
      "rich spoils and innumerable captives of Picenum were lodged in the\n",
      "fortifications of Rimini; and that this formidable chief had defeated\n",
      "his uncle, insulted his capital, and seduced, by secret correspondence,\n",
      "the fidelity of his wife, the imperious daughter of Amalasontha. Yet,\n",
      "before he retired, Vitiges made a last effort, either to storm or\n",
      "to surprise the city. A secret passage was discovered in one of the\n",
      "aqueducts; two citizens of the Vatican were tempted by bribes to\n",
      "intoxicate the guards of the Aurelian gate; an attack was meditated\n",
      "on the walls beyond the Tyber, in a place which was not fortified with\n",
      "towers; and the Barbarians advanced, with torches and scaling-ladders,\n",
      "to the assault of the Pincian gate. But every attempt was defeated by\n",
      "the intrepid vigilance of Belisarius and his band of veterans, who,\n",
      "in the most perilous moments, did not regret the absence of their\n",
      "companions; and the Goths, alike destitute of hope and subsistence,\n",
      "clamorously urged their departure before the truce should expire, and\n",
      "the Roman cavalry should again be united. One year and nine days after\n",
      "the commencement of the siege, an army, so lately strong and triumphant,\n",
      "burnt their tents, and tumultuously repassed the Milvian bridge. They\n",
      "repassed not with impunity: their thronging multitudes, oppressed in a\n",
      "narrow passage, were driven headlong into the Tyber, by their own fears\n",
      "and the pursuit of the enemy; and the Roman general, sallying from the\n",
      "Pincian gate, inflicted a severe and disgraceful wound on their retreat.\n",
      "The slow length of a sickly and desponding host was heavily dragged\n",
      "along the Flaminian way; from whence the Barbarians were sometimes\n",
      "compelled to deviate, lest they should encounter the hostile garrisons\n",
      "that guarded the high road to Rimini and Ravenna. Yet so powerful was\n",
      "this flying army, that Vitiges spared ten thousand men for the defence\n",
      "of the cities which he was most solicitous to preserve, and detached\n",
      "his nephew Uraias, with an adequate force, for the chastisement of\n",
      "rebellious Milan. At the head of his principal army, he besieged Rimini,\n",
      "only thirty-three miles distant from the Gothic capital. A feeble\n",
      "rampart, and a shallow ditch, were maintained by the skill and valor of\n",
      "John the Sanguinary, who shared the danger and fatigue of the meanest\n",
      "soldier, and emulated, on a theatre less illustrious, the military\n",
      "virtues of his great commander. The towers and battering-engines of the\n",
      "Barbarians were rendered useless; their attacks were repulsed; and the\n",
      "tedious blockade, which reduced the garrison to the last extremity of\n",
      "hunger, afforded time for the union and march of the Roman forces.\n",
      "A fleet, which had surprised Ancona, sailed along the coast of the\n",
      "Hadriatic, to the relief of the besieged city. The eunuch Narses landed\n",
      "in Picenum with two thousand Heruli and five thousand of the bravest\n",
      "troops of the East. The rock of the Apennine was forced; ten thousand\n",
      "veterans moved round the foot of the mountains, under the command\n",
      "of Belisarius himself; and a new army, whose encampment blazed with\n",
      "innumerable lights, _appeared_ to advance along the Flaminian way.\n",
      "Overwhelmed with astonishment and despair, the Goths abandoned the siege\n",
      "of Rimini, their tents, their standards, and their leaders; and Vitiges,\n",
      "who gave or followed the example of flight, never halted till he found a\n",
      "shelter within the walls and morasses of Ravenna.\n",
      "\n",
      "To these walls, and to some fortresses destitute of any mutual support,\n",
      "the Gothic monarchy was now reduced. The provinces of Italy had embraced\n",
      "the party of the emperor and his army, gradually recruited to the number\n",
      "of twenty thousand men, must have achieved an easy and rapid conquest,\n",
      "if their invincible powers had not been weakened by the discord of the\n",
      "Roman chiefs. Before the end of the siege, an act of blood, ambiguous\n",
      "and indiscreet, sullied the fair fame of Belisarius. Presidius, a\n",
      "loyal Italian, as he fled from Ravenna to Rome, was rudely stopped by\n",
      "Constantine, the military governor of Spoleto, and despoiled, even in a\n",
      "church, of two daggers richly inlaid with gold and precious stones. As\n",
      "soon as the public danger had subsided, Presidius complained of the loss\n",
      "and injury: his complaint was heard, but the order of restitution was\n",
      "disobeyed by the pride and avarice of the offender. Exasperated by\n",
      "the delay, Presidius boldly arrested the general's horse as he passed\n",
      "through the forum; and, with the spirit of a citizen, demanded the\n",
      "common benefit of the Roman laws. The honor of Belisarius was engaged;\n",
      "he summoned a council; claimed the obedience of his subordinate officer;\n",
      "and was provoked, by an insolent reply, to call hastily for the presence\n",
      "of his guards. Constantine, viewing their entrance as the signal of\n",
      "death, drew his sword, and rushed on the general, who nimbly eluded the\n",
      "stroke, and was protected by his friends; while the desperate assassin\n",
      "was disarmed, dragged into a neighboring chamber, and executed, or\n",
      "rather murdered, by the guards, at the arbitrary command of Belisarius.\n",
      "In this hasty act of violence, the guilt of Constantine was no longer\n",
      "remembered; the despair and death of that valiant officer were secretly\n",
      "imputed to the revenge of Antonina; and each of his colleagues,\n",
      "conscious of the same rapine, was apprehensive of the same fate.\n",
      "The fear of a common enemy suspended the effects of their envy\n",
      "and discontent; but in the confidence of approaching victory, they\n",
      "instigated a powerful rival to oppose the conqueror of Rome and Africa.\n",
      "From the domestic service of the palace, and the administration of the\n",
      "private revenue, Narses the eunuch was suddenly exalted to the head of\n",
      "an army; and the spirit of a hero, who afterwards equalled the merit and\n",
      "glory of Belisarius, served only to perplex the operations of the Gothic\n",
      "war. To his prudent counsels, the relief of Rimini was ascribed by the\n",
      "leaders of the discontented faction, who exhorted Narses to assume an\n",
      "independent and separate command. The epistle of Justinian had indeed\n",
      "enjoined his obedience to the general; but the dangerous exception, \"as\n",
      "far as may be advantageous to the public service,\" reserved some freedom\n",
      "of judgment to the discreet favorite, who had so lately departed from\n",
      "the sacred and familiar conversation of his sovereign. In the exercise\n",
      "of this doubtful right, the eunuch perpetually dissented from the\n",
      "opinions of Belisarius; and, after yielding with reluctance to the siege\n",
      "of Urbino, he deserted his colleague in the night, and marched away to\n",
      "the conquest of the ∆milian province. The fierce and formidable bands\n",
      "of the Heruli were attached to the person of Narses; ten thousand\n",
      "Romans and confederates were persuaded to march under his banners; every\n",
      "malecontent embraced the fair opportunity of revenging his private or\n",
      "imaginary wrongs; and the remaining troops of Belisarius were divided\n",
      "and dispersed from the garrisons of Sicily to the shores of the\n",
      "Hadriatic. His skill and perseverance overcame every obstacle: Urbino\n",
      "was taken, the sieges of FÊsulÊ Orvieto, and Auximum, were undertaken\n",
      "and vigorously prosecuted; and the eunuch Narses was at length recalled\n",
      "to the domestic cares of the palace. All dissensions were healed, and\n",
      "all opposition was subdued, by the temperate authority of the Roman\n",
      "general, to whom his enemies could not refuse their esteem; and\n",
      "Belisarius inculcated the salutary lesson that the forces of the\n",
      "state should compose one body, and be animated by one soul. But in the\n",
      "interval of discord, the Goths were permitted to breathe; an important\n",
      "season was lost, Milan was destroyed, and the northern provinces of\n",
      "Italy were afflicted by an inundation of the Franks.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Justinian first meditated the conquest of Italy, he sent\n",
      "ambassadors to the kings of the Franks, and adjured them, by the common\n",
      "ties of alliance and religion, to join in the holy enterprise against\n",
      "the Arians. The Goths, as their want were more urgent, employed a more\n",
      "effectual mode of persuasion, and vainly strove, by the gift of lands\n",
      "and money, to purchase the friendship, or at least the neutrality, of a\n",
      "light and perfidious nation. But the arms of Belisarius, and the\n",
      "revolt of the Italians, had no sooner shaken the Gothic monarchy,\n",
      "than Theodebert of Austrasia, the most powerful and warlike of the\n",
      "Merovingian kings, was persuaded to succor their distress by an indirect\n",
      "and seasonable aid. Without expecting the consent of their sovereign,\n",
      "the thousand Burgundians, his recent subjects, descended from the Alps,\n",
      "and joined the troops which Vitiges had sent to chastise the revolt of\n",
      "Milan. After an obstinate siege, the capital of Liguria was reduced\n",
      "by famine; but no capitulation could be obtained, except for the safe\n",
      "retreat of the Roman garrison. Datius, the orthodox bishop, who had\n",
      "seduced his countrymen to rebellion and ruin, escaped to the luxury and\n",
      "honors of the Byzantine court; but the clergy, perhaps the Arian clergy,\n",
      "were slaughtered at the foot of their own altars by the defenders of\n",
      "the Catholic faith. Three hundred thousand males were _reported_ to be\n",
      "slain; the female sex, and the more precious spoil, was resigned to\n",
      "the Burgundians; and the houses, or at least the walls, of Milan,\n",
      "were levelled with the ground. The Goths, in their last moments, were\n",
      "revenged by the destruction of a city, second only to Rome in size\n",
      "and opulence, in the splendor of its buildings, or the number of\n",
      "its inhabitants; and Belisarius sympathized alone in the fate of his\n",
      "deserted and devoted friends. Encouraged by this successful inroad,\n",
      "Theodebert himself, in the ensuing spring, invaded the plains of Italy\n",
      "with an army of one hundred thousand Barbarians. The king, and some\n",
      "chosen followers, were mounted on horseback, and armed with lances; the\n",
      "infantry, without bows or spears, were satisfied with a shield, a sword,\n",
      "and a double-edged battle-axe, which, in their hands, became a deadly\n",
      "and unerring weapon. Italy trembled at the march of the Franks; and\n",
      "both the Gothic prince and the Roman general, alike ignorant of their\n",
      "designs, solicited, with hope and terror, the friendship of these\n",
      "dangerous allies. Till he had secured the passage of the Po on the\n",
      "bridge of Pavia, the grandson of Clovis dissembled his intentions, which\n",
      "he at length declared, by assaulting, almost at the same instant, the\n",
      "hostile camps of the Romans and Goths. Instead of uniting their arms,\n",
      "they fled with equal precipitation; and the fertile, though desolate\n",
      "provinces of Liguria and ∆milia, were abandoned to a licentious host of\n",
      "Barbarians, whose rage was not mitigated by any thoughts of settlement\n",
      "or conquest. Among the cities which they ruined, Genoa, not yet\n",
      "constructed of marble, is particularly enumerated; and the deaths of\n",
      "thousands, according to the regular practice of war, appear to have\n",
      "excited less horror than some idolatrous sacrifices of women and\n",
      "children, which were performed with impunity in the camp of the most\n",
      "Christian king. If it were not a melancholy truth, that the first and\n",
      "most cruel sufferings must be the lot of the innocent and helpless,\n",
      "history might exult in the misery of the conquerors, who, in the midst\n",
      "of riches, were left destitute of bread or wine, reduced to drink the\n",
      "waters of the Po, and to feed on the flesh of distempered cattle. The\n",
      "dysentery swept away one third of their army; and the clamors of his\n",
      "subjects, who were impatient to pass the Alps, disposed Theodebert to\n",
      "listen with respect to the mild exhortations of Belisarius. The memory\n",
      "of this inglorious and destructive warfare was perpetuated on the medals\n",
      "of Gaul; and Justinian, without unsheathing his sword, assumed the title\n",
      "of conqueror of the Franks. The Merovingian prince was offended by the\n",
      "vanity of the emperor; he affected to pity the fallen fortunes of the\n",
      "Goths; and his insidious offer of a federal union was fortified by\n",
      "the promise or menace of descending from the Alps at the head of five\n",
      "hundred thousand men. His plans of conquest were boundless, and perhaps\n",
      "chimerical. The king of Austrasia threatened to chastise Justinian, and\n",
      "to march to the gates of Constantinople: he was overthrown and slain by\n",
      "a wild bull, as he hunted in the Belgic or German forests.\n",

      "As soon as Belisarius was delivered from his foreign and domestic\n",
      "enemies, he seriously applied his forces to the final reduction of\n",
      "Italy. In the siege of Osimo, the general was nearly transpierced with\n",
      "an arrow, if the mortal stroke had not been intercepted by one of his\n",
      "guards, who lost, in that pious office, the use of his hand. The Goths\n",
      "of Osimo, four thousand warriors, with those of FÊsulÊ and the Cottian\n",
      "Alps, were among the last who maintained their independence; and their\n",
      "gallant resistance, which almost tired the patience, deserved the\n",
      "esteem, of the conqueror. His prudence refused to subscribe the safe\n",
      "conduct which they asked, to join their brethren of Ravenna; but they\n",
      "saved, by an honorable capitulation, one moiety at least of their\n",
      "wealth, with the free alternative of retiring peaceably to their\n",
      "estates, or enlisting to serve the emperor in his Persian wars. The\n",
      "multitudes which yet adhered to the standard of Vitiges far surpassed\n",
      "the number of the Roman troops; but neither prayers nor defiance, nor\n",
      "the extreme danger of his most faithful subjects, could tempt the Gothic\n",
      "king beyond the fortifications of Ravenna. These fortifications were,\n",
      "indeed, impregnable to the assaults of art or violence; and when\n",
      "Belisarius invested the capital, he was soon convinced that famine only\n",
      "could tame the stubborn spirit of the Barbarians. The sea, the land,\n",
      "and the channels of the Po, were guarded by the vigilance of the Roman\n",
      "general; and his morality extended the rights of war to the practice of\n",
      "poisoning the waters, and secretly firing the granaries of a besieged\n",
      "city. While he pressed the blockade of Ravenna, he was surprised by the\n",
      "arrival of two ambassadors from Constantinople, with a treaty of peace,\n",
      "which Justinian had imprudently signed, without deigning to consult the\n",
      "author of his victory. By this disgraceful and precarious agreement,\n",
      "Italy and the Gothic treasure were divided, and the provinces beyond\n",
      "the Po were left with the regal title to the successor of Theodoric.\n",
      "The ambassadors were eager to accomplish their salutary commission;\n",
      "the captive Vitiges accepted, with transport, the unexpected offer of\n",
      "a crown; honor was less prevalent among the Goths, than the want and\n",
      "appetite of food; and the Roman chiefs, who murmured at the continuance\n",
      "of the war, professed implicit submission to the commands of the\n",
      "emperor. If Belisarius had possessed only the courage of a soldier,\n",
      "the laurel would have been snatched from his hand by timid and envious\n",
      "counsels; but in this decisive moment, he resolved, with the magnanimity\n",
      "of a statesman, to sustain alone the danger and merit of generous\n",
      "disobedience. Each of his officers gave a written opinion that the siege\n",
      "of Ravenna was impracticable and hopeless: the general then rejected the\n",
      "treaty of partition, and declared his own resolution of leading Vitiges\n",
      "in chains to the feet of Justinian. The Goths retired with doubt and\n",
      "dismay: this peremptory refusal deprived them of the only signature\n",
      "which they could trust, and filled their minds with a just apprehension,\n",
      "that a sagacious enemy had discovered the full extent of their\n",
      "deplorable state. They compared the fame and fortune of Belisarius with\n",
      "the weakness of their ill-fated king; and the comparison suggested an\n",
      "extraordinary project, to which Vitiges, with apparent resignation, was\n",
      "compelled to acquiesce. Partition would ruin the strength, exile would\n",
      "disgrace the honor, of the nation; but they offered their arms, their\n",
      "treasures, and the fortifications of Ravenna, if Belisarius would\n",
      "disclaim the authority of a master, accept the choice of the Goths, and\n",
      "assume, as he had deserved, the kingdom of Italy. If the false lustre\n",
      "of a diadem could have tempted the loyalty of a faithful subject, his\n",
      "prudence must have foreseen the inconstancy of the Barbarians, and his\n",
      "rational ambition would prefer the safe and honorable station of a\n",
      "Roman general. Even the patience and seeming satisfaction with which he\n",
      "entertained a proposal of treason, might be susceptible of a malignant\n",
      "interpretation. But the lieutenant of Justinian was conscious of his own\n",
      "rectitude; he entered into a dark and crooked path, as it might lead\n",
      "to the voluntary submission of the Goths; and his dexterous policy\n",
      "persuaded them that he was disposed to comply with their wishes, without\n",
      "engaging an oath or a promise for the performance of a treaty which he\n",
      "secretly abhorred. The day of the surrender of Ravenna was stipulated\n",
      "by the Gothic ambassadors: a fleet, laden with provisions, sailed as\n",
      "a welcome guest into the deepest recess of the harbor: the gates were\n",
      "opened to the fancied king of Italy; and Belisarius, without meeting an\n",
      "enemy, triumphantly marched through the streets of an impregnable city.\n",
      "The Romans were astonished by their success; the multitudes of tall and\n",
      "robust Barbarians were confounded by the image of their own patience and\n",
      "the masculine females, spitting in the faces of their sons and husbands,\n",
      "most bitterly reproached them for betraying their dominion and freedom\n",
      "to these pygmies of the south, contemptible in their numbers, diminutive\n",
      "in their stature. Before the Goths could recover from the first\n",
      "surprise, and claim the accomplishment of their doubtful hopes, the\n",
      "victor established his power in Ravenna, beyond the danger of repentance\n",
      "and revolt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vitiges, who perhaps had attempted to escape, was honorably guarded in\n",
      "his palace; the flower of the Gothic youth was selected for the service\n",
      "of the emperor; the remainder of the people was dismissed to their\n",
      "peaceful habitations in the southern provinces; and a colony of Italians\n",
      "was invited to replenish the depopulated city. The submission of the\n",
      "capital was imitated in the towns and villages of Italy, which had not\n",
      "been subdued, or even visited, by the Romans; and the independent Goths,\n",
      "who remained in arms at Pavia and Verona, were ambitious only to become\n",
      "the subjects of Belisarius. But his inflexible loyalty rejected, except\n",
      "as the substitute of Justinian, their oaths of allegiance; and he was\n",
      "not offended by the reproach of their deputies, that he rather chose to\n",
      "be a slave than a king.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the second victory of Belisarius, envy again whispered, Justinian\n",
      "listened, and the hero was recalled. \"The remnant of the Gothic war was\n",
      "no longer worthy of his presence: a gracious sovereign was impatient to\n",
      "reward his services, and to consult his wisdom; and he alone was\n",
      "capable of defending the East against the innumerable armies of Persia.\"\n",
      "Belisarius understood the suspicion, accepted the excuse, embarked at\n",
      "Ravenna his spoils and trophies; and proved, by his ready obedience,\n",
      "that such an abrupt removal from the government of Italy was not less\n",
      "unjust than it might have been indiscreet. The emperor received with\n",
      "honorable courtesy both Vitiges and his more noble consort; and as the\n",
      "king of the Goths conformed to the Athanasian faith, he obtained, with\n",
      "a rich inheritance of land in Asia, the rank of senator and patrician.\n",
      "Every spectator admired, without peril, the strength and stature of the\n",
      "young Barbarians: they adored the majesty of the throne, and promised to\n",
      "shed their blood in the service of their benefactor. Justinian deposited\n",
      "in the Byzantine palace the treasures of the Gothic monarchy. A\n",
      "flattering senate was sometime admitted to gaze on the magnificent\n",
      "spectacle; but it was enviously secluded from the public view: and the\n",
      "conqueror of Italy renounced, without a murmur, perhaps without a sigh,\n",
      "the well-earned honors of a second triumph. His glory was indeed exalted\n",
      "above all external pomp; and the faint and hollow praises of the court\n",
      "were supplied, even in a servile age, by the respect and admiration of\n",
      "his country. Whenever he appeared in the streets and public places\n",
      "of Constantinople, Belisarius attracted and satisfied the eyes of the\n",
      "people. His lofty stature and majestic countenance fulfilled their\n",
      "expectations of a hero; the meanest of his fellow-citizens were\n",
      "emboldened by his gentle and gracious demeanor; and the martial train\n",
      "which attended his footsteps left his person more accessible than in a\n",
      "day of battle. Seven thousand horsemen, matchless for beauty and valor,\n",
      "were maintained in the service, and at the private expense, of the\n",
      "general. Their prowess was always conspicuous in single combats, or\n",
      "in the foremost ranks; and both parties confessed that in the siege of\n",
      "Rome, the guards of Belisarius had alone vanquished the Barbarian\n",
      "host. Their numbers were continually augmented by the bravest and most\n",
      "faithful of the enemy; and his fortunate captives, the Vandals, the\n",
      "Moors, and the Goths, emulated the attachment of his domestic followers.\n",
      "By the union of liberality and justice, he acquired the love of the\n",
      "soldiers, without alienating the affections of the people. The sick\n",
      "and wounded were relieved with medicines and money; and still more\n",
      "efficaciously, by the healing visits and smiles of their commander. The\n",
      "loss of a weapon or a horse was instantly repaired, and each deed of\n",
      "valor was rewarded by the rich and honorable gifts of a bracelet or a\n",
      "collar, which were rendered more precious by the judgment of Belisarius.\n",
      "He was endeared to the husbandmen by the peace and plenty which they\n",
      "enjoyed under the shadow of his standard. Instead of being injured, the\n",
      "country was enriched by the march of the Roman armies; and such was the\n",
      "rigid discipline of their camp, that not an apple was gathered from the\n",
      "tree, not a path could be traced in the fields of corn. Belisarius was\n",
      "chaste and sober. In the license of a military life, none could boast\n",
      "that they had seen him intoxicated with wine: the most beautiful\n",
      "captives of Gothic or Vandal race were offered to his embraces; but he\n",
      "turned aside from their charms, and the husband of Antonina was never\n",
      "suspected of violating the laws of conjugal fidelity. The spectator and\n",
      "historian of his exploits has observed, that amidst the perils of war,\n",
      "he was daring without rashness, prudent without fear, slow or rapid\n",
      "according to the exigencies of the moment; that in the deepest distress\n",
      "he was animated by real or apparent hope, but that he was modest and\n",
      "humble in the most prosperous fortune. By these virtues, he equalled or\n",
      "excelled the ancient masters of the military art. Victory, by sea and\n",
      "land, attended his arms. He subdued Africa, Italy, and the adjacent\n",
      "islands; led away captives the successors of Genseric and Theodoric;\n",
      "filled Constantinople with the spoils of their palaces; and in the space\n",
      "of six years recovered half the provinces of the Western empire. In his\n",
      "fame and merit, in wealth and power, he remained without a rival, the\n",
      "first of the Roman subjects; the voice of envy could only magnify his\n",
      "dangerous importance; and the emperor might applaud his own discerning\n",
      "spirit, which had discovered and raised the genius of Belisarius.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the custom of the Roman triumphs, that a slave should be placed\n",
      "behind the chariot to remind the conqueror of the instability of\n",
      "fortune, and the infirmities of human nature. Procopius, in his\n",
      "Anecdotes, has assumed that servile and ungrateful office. The generous\n",
      "reader may cast away the libel, but the evidence of facts will adhere to\n",
      "his memory; and he will reluctantly confess, that the fame, and even\n",
      "the virtue, of Belisarius, were polluted by the lust and cruelty of his\n",
      "wife; and that hero deserved an appellation which may not drop from the\n",
      "pen of the decent historian. The mother of Antonina was a theatrical\n",
      "prostitute, and both her father and grandfather exercised, at\n",
      "Thessalonica and Constantinople, the vile, though lucrative, profession\n",
      "of charioteers. In the various situations of their fortune she became\n",
      "the companion, the enemy, the servant, and the favorite of the empress\n",
      "Theodora: these loose and ambitious females had been connected by\n",
      "similar pleasures; they were separated by the jealousy of vice, and at\n",
      "length reconciled by the partnership of guilt. Before her marriage with\n",
      "Belisarius, Antonina had one husband and many lovers: Photius, the son\n",
      "of her former nuptials, was of an age to distinguish himself at the\n",
      "siege of Naples; and it was not till the autumn of her age and\n",
      "beauty that she indulged a scandalous attachment to a Thracian youth.\n",
      "Theodosius had been educated in the Eunomian heresy; the African voyage\n",
      "was consecrated by the baptism and auspicious name of the first soldier\n",
      "who embarked; and the proselyte was adopted into the family of his\n",
      "spiritual parents, Belisarius and Antonina. Before they touched the\n",
      "shores of Africa, this holy kindred degenerated into sensual love: and\n",
      "as Antonina soon overleaped the bounds of modesty and caution, the Roman\n",
      "general was alone ignorant of his own dishonor. During their residence\n",
      "at Carthage, he surprised the two lovers in a subterraneous chamber,\n",
      "solitary, warm, and almost naked. Anger flashed from his eyes. \"With the\n",
      "help of this young man,\" said the unblushing Antonina, \"I was secreting\n",
      "our most precious effects from the knowledge of Justinian.\" The youth\n",
      "resumed his garments, and the pious husband consented to disbelieve the\n",
      "evidence of his own senses. From this pleasing and perhaps voluntary\n",
      "delusion, Belisarius was awakened at Syracuse, by the officious\n",
      "information of Macedonia; and that female attendant, after requiring an\n",
      "oath for her security, produced two chamberlains, who, like herself, had\n",
      "often beheld the adulteries of Antonina. A hasty flight into Asia saved\n",
      "Theodosius from the justice of an injured husband, who had signified to\n",
      "one of his guards the order of his death; but the tears of Antonina, and\n",
      "her artful seductions, assured the credulous hero of her innocence: and\n",
      "he stooped, against his faith and judgment, to abandon those imprudent\n",
      "friends, who had presumed to accuse or doubt the chastity of his wife.\n",
      "The revenge of a guilty woman is implacable and bloody: the unfortunate\n",
      "Macedonia, with the two witnesses, were secretly arrested by the\n",
      "minister of her cruelty; their tongues were cut out, their bodies were\n",
      "hacked into small pieces, and their remains were cast into the Sea of\n",
      "Syracuse. A rash though judicious saying of Constantine, \"I would sooner\n",
      "have punished the adulteress than the boy,\" was deeply remembered by\n",
      "Antonina; and two years afterwards, when despair had armed that officer\n",
      "against his general, her sanguinary advice decided and hastened his\n",
      "execution. Even the indignation of Photius was not forgiven by his\n",
      "mother; the exile of her son prepared the recall of her lover; and\n",
      "Theodosius condescended to accept the pressing and humble invitation of\n",
      "the conqueror of Italy. In the absolute direction of his household, and\n",
      "in the important commissions of peace and war, the favorite youth most\n",
      "rapidly acquired a fortune of four hundred thousand pounds sterling; and\n",
      "after their return to Constantinople, the passion of Antonina, at\n",
      "least, continued ardent and unabated. But fear, devotion, and lassitude\n",
      "perhaps, inspired Theodosius with more serious thoughts. He dreaded the\n",
      "busy scandal of the capital, and the indiscreet fondness of the wife of\n",
      "Belisarius; escaped from her embraces, and retiring to Ephesus, shaved\n",
      "his head, and took refuge in the sanctuary of a monastic life. The\n",
      "despair of the new Ariadne could scarcely have been excused by the death\n",
      "of her husband. She wept, she tore her hair, she filled the palace with\n",
      "her cries; \"she had lost the dearest of friends, a tender, a faithful, a\n",
      "laborious friend!\" But her warm entreaties, fortified by the prayers of\n",
      "Belisarius, were insufficient to draw the holy monk from the solitude of\n",
      "Ephesus. It was not till the general moved forward for the Persian war,\n",
      "that Theodosius could be tempted to return to Constantinople; and the\n",
      "short interval before the departure of Antonina herself was boldly\n",
      "devoted to love and pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "A philosopher may pity and forgive the infirmities of female nature,\n",
      "from which he receives no real injury: but contemptible is the husband\n",
      "who feels, and yet endures, his own infamy in that of his wife. Antonina\n",
      "pursued her son with implacable hatred; and the gallant Photius was\n",
      "exposed to her secret persecutions in the camp beyond the Tigris.\n",
      "Enraged by his own wrongs, and by the dishonor of his blood, he cast\n",
      "away in his turn the sentiments of nature, and revealed to Belisarius\n",
      "the turpitude of a woman who had violated all the duties of a mother\n",
      "and a wife. From the surprise and indignation of the Roman general, his\n",
      "former credulity appears to have been sincere: he embraced the knees of\n",
      "the son of Antonina, adjured him to remember his obligations rather than\n",
      "his birth, and confirmed at the altar their holy vows of revenge and\n",
      "mutual defence. The dominion of Antonina was impaired by absence; and\n",
      "when she met her husband, on his return from the Persian confines,\n",
      "Belisarius, in his first and transient emotions, confined her person,\n",
      "and threatened her life. Photius was more resolved to punish, and less\n",
      "prompt to pardon: he flew to Ephesus; extorted from a trusty eunuch of\n",
      "his another the full confession of her guilt; arrested Theodosius and\n",
      "his treasures in the church of St. John the Apostle, and concealed his\n",
      "captives, whose execution was only delayed, in a secure and sequestered\n",
      "fortress of Cilicia. Such a daring outrage against public justice could\n",
      "not pass with impunity; and the cause of Antonina was espoused by the\n",
      "empress, whose favor she had deserved by the recent services of the\n",
      "disgrace of a prÊfect, and the exile and murder of a pope. At the end of\n",
      "the campaign, Belisarius was recalled; he complied, as usual, with\n",
      "the Imperial mandate. His mind was not prepared for rebellion: his\n",
      "obedience, however adverse to the dictates of honor, was consonant to\n",
      "the wishes of his heart; and when he embraced his wife, at the command,\n",
      "and perhaps in the presence, of the empress, the tender husband was\n",
      "disposed to forgive or to be forgiven. The bounty of Theodora reserved\n",
      "for her companion a more precious favor. \"I have found,\" she said, \"my\n",
      "dearest patrician, a pearl of inestimable value; it has not yet been\n",
      "viewed by any mortal eye; but the sight and the possession of this jewel\n",
      "are destined for my friend.\" As soon as the curiosity and impatience\n",
      "of Antonina were kindled, the door of a bed-chamber was thrown open, and\n",
      "she beheld her lover, whom the diligence of the eunuchs had discovered\n",
      "in his secret prison. Her silent wonder burst into passionate\n",
      "exclamations of gratitude and joy, and she named Theodora her queen, her\n",
      "benefactress, and her savior. The monk of Ephesus was nourished in the\n",
      "palace with luxury and ambition; but instead of assuming, as he was\n",
      "promised, the command of the Roman armies, Theodosius expired in the\n",
      "first fatigues of an amorous interview. The grief of Antonina could only\n",
      "be assuaged by the sufferings of her son. A youth of consular rank, and\n",
      "a sickly constitution, was punished, without a trial, like a malefactor\n",
      "and a slave: yet such was the constancy of his mind, that Photius\n",
      "sustained the tortures of the scourge and the rack, without violating\n",
      "the faith which he had sworn to Belisarius. After this fruitless\n",
      "cruelty, the son of Antonina, while his mother feasted with the\n",
      "empress, was buried in her subterraneous prisons, which admitted not\n",
      "the distinction of night and day. He twice escaped to the most venerable\n",
      "sanctuaries of Constantinople, the churches of St. Sophia, and of the\n",
      "Virgin: but his tyrants were insensible of religion as of pity; and the\n",
      "helpless youth, amidst the clamors of the clergy and people, was twice\n",
      "dragged from the altar to the dungeon. His third attempt was more\n",
      "successful. At the end of three years, the prophet Zachariah, or some\n",
      "mortal friend, indicated the means of an escape: he eluded the spies and\n",
      "guards of the empress, reached the holy sepulchre of Jerusalem, embraced\n",
      "the profession of a monk; and the abbot Photius was employed, after the\n",
      "death of Justinian, to reconcile and regulate the churches of Egypt.\n",
      "The son of Antonina suffered all that an enemy can inflict: her patient\n",
      "husband imposed on himself the more exquisite misery of violating his\n",
      "promise and deserting his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the succeeding campaign, Belisarius was again sent against the\n",
      "Persians: he saved the East, but he offended Theodora, and perhaps the\n",
      "emperor himself. The malady of Justinian had countenanced the rumor of\n",
      "his death; and the Roman general, on the supposition of that probable\n",
      "event spoke the free language of a citizen and a soldier. His colleague\n",
      "Buzes, who concurred in the same sentiments, lost his rank, his liberty,\n",
      "and his health, by the persecution of the empress: but the disgrace of\n",
      "Belisarius was alleviated by the dignity of his own character, and the\n",
      "influence of his wife, who might wish to humble, but could not desire to\n",
      "ruin, the partner of her fortunes. Even his removal was colored by the\n",
      "assurance, that the sinking state of Italy would be retrieved by the\n",
      "single presence of its conqueror. But no sooner had he returned, alone\n",
      "and defenceless, than a hostile commission was sent to the East, to\n",
      "seize his treasures and criminate his actions; the guards and veterans,\n",
      "who followed his private banner, were distributed among the chiefs of\n",
      "the army, and even the eunuchs presumed to cast lots for the partition\n",
      "of his martial domestics. When he passed with a small and sordid retinue\n",
      "through the streets of Constantinople, his forlorn appearance excited\n",
      "the amazement and compassion of the people. Justinian and Theodora\n",
      "received him with cold ingratitude; the servile crowd, with insolence\n",
      "and contempt; and in the evening he retired with trembling steps to\n",
      "his deserted palace. An indisposition, feigned or real, had confined\n",
      "Antonina to her apartment; and she walked disdainfully silent in\n",
      "the adjacent portico, while Belisarius threw himself on his bed, and\n",
      "expected, in an agony of grief and terror, the death which he had so\n",
      "often braved under the walls of Rome. Long after sunset a messenger\n",
      "was announced from the empress: he opened, with anxious curiosity, the\n",
      "letter which contained the sentence of his fate. \"You cannot be ignorant\n",
      "how much you have deserved my displeasure. I am not insensible of the\n",
      "services of Antonina. To her merits and intercession I have granted your\n",
      "life, and permit you to retain a part of your treasures, which might be\n",
      "justly forfeited to the state. Let your gratitude, where it is due, be\n",
      "displayed, not in words, but in your future behavior.\" I know not how to\n",
      "believe or to relate the transports with which the hero is said to have\n",
      "received this ignominious pardon. He fell prostrate before his wife,\n",
      "he kissed the feet of his savior, and he devoutly promised to live the\n",
      "grateful and submissive slave of Antonina. A fine of one hundred\n",
      "and twenty thousand pounds sterling was levied on the fortunes of\n",
      "Belisarius; and with the office of count, or master of the royal\n",
      "stables, he accepted the conduct of the Italian war. At his departure\n",
      "from Constantinople, his friends, and even the public, were persuaded\n",
      "that as soon as he regained his freedom, he would renounce his\n",
      "dissimulation, and that his wife, Theodora, and perhaps the emperor\n",
      "himself, would be sacrificed to the just revenge of a virtuous rebel.\n",
      "Their hopes were deceived; and the unconquerable patience and loyalty of\n",
      "Belisarius appear either _below_ or _above_ the character of a man.\n",

      "placed above the heroes of the ancient republics. His imperfections\n",
      "flowed from the contagion of the times; his virtues were his own, the\n",
      "free gift of nature or reflection; he raised himself without a master or\n",
      "a rival; and so inadequate were the arms committed to his hand, that\n",
      "his sole advantage was derived from the pride and presumption of his\n",
      "adversaries. Under his command, the subjects of Justinian often deserved\n",
      "to be called Romans: but the unwarlike appellation of Greeks was imposed\n",
      "as a term of reproach by the haughty Goths; who affected to blush,\n",
      "that they must dispute the kingdom of Italy with a nation of tragedians\n",
      "pantomimes, and pirates. The climate of Asia has indeed been found\n",
      "less congenial than that of Europe to military spirit: those populous\n",
      "countries were enervated by luxury, despotism, and superstition; and\n",
      "the monks were more expensive and more numerous than the soldiers of the\n",
      "East. The regular force of the empire had once amounted to six hundred\n",
      "and forty-five thousand men: it was reduced, in the time of Justinian,\n",
      "to one hundred and fifty thousand; and this number, large as it may\n",
      "seem, was thinly scattered over the sea and land; in Spain and Italy, in\n",
      "Africa and Egypt, on the banks of the Danube, the coast of the Euxine,\n",
      "and the frontiers of Persia. The citizen was exhausted, yet the soldier\n",
      "was unpaid; his poverty was mischievously soothed by the privilege\n",
      "of rapine and indolence; and the tardy payments were detained and\n",
      "intercepted by the fraud of those agents who usurp, without courage or\n",
      "danger, the emoluments of war. Public and private distress recruited the\n",
      "armies of the state; but in the field, and still more in the presence\n",
      "of the enemy, their numbers were always defective. The want of national\n",
      "spirit was supplied by the precarious faith and disorderly service of\n",
      "Barbarian mercenaries. Even military honor, which has often survived the\n",
      "loss of virtue and freedom, was almost totally extinct. The generals,\n",
      "who were multiplied beyond the example of former times, labored only to\n",
      "prevent the success, or to sully the reputation of their colleagues; and\n",
      "they had been taught by experience, that if merit sometimes provoked\n",
      "the jealousy, error, or even guilt, would obtain the indulgence, of\n",
      "a gracious emperor. In such an age, the triumphs of Belisarius, and\n",
      "afterwards of Narses, shine with incomparable lustre; but they are\n",
      "encompassed with the darkest shades of disgrace and calamity. While the\n",
      "lieutenant of Justinian subdued the kingdoms of the Goths and Vandals,\n",
      "the emperor, timid, though ambitious, balanced the forces of the\n",
      "Barbarians, fomented their divisions by flattery and falsehood, and\n",
      "invited by his patience and liberality the repetition of injuries. The\n",
      "keys of Carthage, Rome, and Ravenna, were presented to their conqueror,\n",
      "while Antioch was destroyed by the Persians, and Justinian trembled for\n",
      "the safety of Constantinople.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the Gothic victories of Belisarius were prejudicial to the state,\n",
      "since they abolished the important barrier of the Upper Danube, which\n",
      "had been so faithfully guarded by Theodoric and his daughter. For the\n",
      "defence of Italy, the Goths evacuated Pannonia and Noricum, which\n",
      "they left in a peaceful and flourishing condition: the sovereignty\n",
      "was claimed by the emperor of the Romans; the actual possession was\n",
      "abandoned to the boldness of the first invader. On the opposite banks of\n",
      "the Danube, the plains of Upper Hungary and the Transylvanian hills were\n",
      "possessed, since the death of Attila, by the tribes of the GepidÊ, who\n",
      "respected the Gothic arms, and despised, not indeed the gold of the\n",
      "Romans, but the secret motive of their annual subsidies. The vacant\n",
      "fortifications of the river were instantly occupied by these Barbarians;\n",
      "their standards were planted on the walls of Sirmium and Belgrade; and\n",
      "the ironical tone of their apology aggravated this insult on the majesty\n",
      "of the empire. \"So extensive, O CÊsar, are your dominions, so numerous\n",
      "are your cities, that you are continually seeking for nations to whom,\n",
      "either in peace or in war, you may relinquish these useless possessions.\n",
      "The GepidÊ are your brave and faithful allies; and if they have\n",
      "anticipated your gifts, they have shown a just confidence in your\n",
      "bounty.\" Their presumption was excused by the mode of revenge which\n",
      "Justinian embraced. Instead of asserting the rights of a sovereign for\n",
      "the protection of his subjects, the emperor invited a strange people to\n",
      "invade and possess the Roman provinces between the Danube and the Alps\n",
      "and the ambition of the GepidÊ was checked by the rising power and\n",
      "fame of the Lombards. This corrupt appellation has been diffused in the\n",
      "thirteenth century by the merchants and bankers, the Italian posterity\n",
      "of these savage warriors: but the original name of _Langobards_ is\n",
      "expressive only of the peculiar length and fashion of their beards. I am\n",
      "not disposed either to question or to justify their Scandinavian origin;\n",
      "nor to pursue the migrations of the Lombards through unknown regions and\n",
      "marvellous adventures. About the time of Augustus and Trajan, a ray of\n",
      "historic light breaks on the darkness of their antiquities, and they are\n",
      "discovered, for the first time, between the Elbe and the Oder. Fierce,\n",
      "beyond the example of the Germans, they delighted to propagate the\n",
      "tremendous belief, that their heads were formed like the heads of dogs,\n",
      "and that they drank the blood of their enemies, whom they vanquished in\n",
      "battle. The smallness of their numbers was recruited by the adoption of\n",
      "their bravest slaves; and alone, amidst their powerful neighbors, they\n",
      "defended by arms their high-spirited independence. In the tempests of\n",
      "the north, which overwhelmed so many names and nations, this little bark\n",
      "of the Lombards still floated on the surface: they gradually descended\n",
      "towards the south and the Danube, and, at the end of four hundred years,\n",
      "they again appear with their ancient valor and renown. Their manners\n",
      "were not less ferocious. The assassination of a royal guest was executed\n",
      "in the presence, and by the command, of the king's daughter, who\n",
      "had been provoked by some words of insult, and disappointed by his\n",
      "diminutive stature; and a tribute, the price of blood, was imposed on\n",
      "the Lombards, by his brother the king of the Heruli. Adversity revived\n",
      "a sense of moderation and justice, and the insolence of conquest was\n",
      "chastised by the signal defeat and irreparable dispersion of the Heruli,\n",
      "who were seated in the southern provinces of Poland. The victories of\n",
      "the Lombards recommended them to the friendship of the emperors; and\n",
      "at the solicitations of Justinian, they passed the Danube, to reduce,\n",
      "according to their treaty, the cities of Noricum and the fortresses of\n",
      "Pannonia. But the spirit of rapine soon tempted them beyond these\n",
      "ample limits; they wandered along the coast of the Hadriatic as far as\n",
      "Dyrrachium, and presumed, with familiar rudeness to enter the towns and\n",
      "houses of their Roman allies, and to seize the captives who had escaped\n",
      "from their audacious hands. These acts of hostility, the sallies, as\n",
      "it might be pretended, of some loose adventurers, were disowned by the\n",
      "nation, and excused by the emperor; but the arms of the Lombards\n",
      "were more seriously engaged by a contest of thirty years, which was\n",
      "terminated only by the extirpation of the GepidÊ. The hostile nations\n",
      "often pleaded their cause before the throne of Constantinople; and the\n",
      "crafty Justinian, to whom the Barbarians were almost equally odious,\n",
      "pronounced a partial and ambiguous sentence, and dexterously protracted\n",
      "the war by slow and ineffectual succors. Their strength was formidable,\n",
      "since the Lombards, who sent into the field several _myriads_ of\n",
      "soldiers, still claimed, as the weaker side, the protection of the\n",
      "Romans. Their spirit was intrepid; yet such is the uncertainty of\n",
      "courage, that the two armies were suddenly struck with a panic; they\n",
      "fled from each other, and the rival kings remained with their guards\n",
      "in the midst of an empty plain. A short truce was obtained; but their\n",
      "mutual resentment again kindled; and the remembrance of their shame\n",
      "rendered the next encounter more desperate and bloody Forty thousand of\n",
      "the Barbarians perished in the decisive battle, which broke the power\n",
      "of the GepidÊ, transferred the fears and wishes of Justinian, and first\n",
      "displayed the character of Alboin, the youthful prince of the Lombards,\n",
      "and the future conqueror of Italy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wild people who dwelt or wandered in the plains of Russia,\n",
      "Lithuania, and Poland, might be reduced, in the age of Justinian, under\n",
      "the two great families of the Bulgarians and the Sclavonians. According\n",
      "to the Greek writers, the former, who touched the Euxine and the Lake\n",
      "MÊotis, derived from the Huns their name or descent; and it is needless\n",
      "to renew the simple and well-known picture of Tartar manners. They\n",
      "were bold and dexterous archers, who drank the milk, and feasted on the\n",
      "flesh, of their fleet and indefatigable horses; whose flocks and herds\n",
      "followed, or rather guided, the motions of their roving camps; to whose\n",
      "inroads no country was remote or impervious, and who were practised\n",
      "in flight, though incapable of fear. The nation was divided into two\n",
      "powerful and hostile tribes, who pursued each other with fraternal\n",
      "hatred. They eagerly disputed the friendship, or rather the gifts, of\n",
      "the emperor; and the distinctions which nature had fixed between the\n",
      "faithful dog and the rapacious wolf was applied by an ambassador who\n",
      "received only verbal instructions from the mouth of his illiterate\n",
      "prince. The Bulgarians, of whatsoever species, were equally attracted\n",
      "by Roman wealth: they assumed a vague dominion over the Sclavonian name,\n",
      "and their rapid marches could only be stopped by the Baltic Sea, or the\n",
      "extreme cold and poverty of the north. But the same race of Sclavonians\n",
      "appears to have maintained, in every age, the possession of the same\n",
      "countries. Their numerous tribes, however distant or adverse, used one\n",
      "common language, (it was harsh and irregular,) and where known by the\n",
      "resemblance of their form, which deviated from the swarthy Tartar, and\n",
      "approached without attaining the lofty stature and fair complexion of\n",
      "the German. Four thousand six hundred villages were scattered over the\n",
      "provinces of Russia and Poland, and their huts were hastily built of\n",
      "rough timber, in a country deficient both in stone and iron. Erected,\n",
      "or rather concealed, in the depth of forests, on the banks of rivers,\n",
      "or the edges of morasses, we may not perhaps, without flattery, compare\n",
      "them to the architecture of the beaver; which they resembled in a double\n",
      "issue, to the land and water, for the escape of the savage inhabitant,\n",
      "an animal less cleanly, less diligent, and less social, than that\n",
      "marvellous quadruped. The fertility of the soil, rather than the labor\n",
      "of the natives, supplied the rustic plenty of the Sclavonians. Their\n",
      "sheep and horned cattle were large and numerous, and the fields which\n",
      "they sowed with millet or panic afforded, in place of bread, a coarse\n",
      "and less nutritive food. The incessant rapine of their neighbors\n",
      "compelled them to bury this treasure in the earth; but on the appearance\n",
      "of a stranger, it was freely imparted by a people, whose unfavorable\n",
      "character is qualified by the epithets of chaste, patient, and\n",
      "hospitable. As their supreme god, they adored an invisible master of the\n",
      "thunder. The rivers and the nymphs obtained their subordinate honors,\n",
      "and the popular worship was expressed in vows and sacrifice. The\n",
      "Sclavonians disdained to obey a despot, a prince, or even a magistrate;\n",
      "but their experience was too narrow, their passions too headstrong, to\n",
      "compose a system of equal law or general defence. Some voluntary respect\n",
      "was yielded to age and valor; but each tribe or village existed as\n",
      "a separate republic, and all must be persuaded where none could be\n",
      "compelled. They fought on foot, almost naked, and except an unwieldy\n",
      "shield, without any defensive armor; their weapons of offence were a\n",
      "bow, a quiver of small poisoned arrows, and a long rope, which they\n",
      "dexterously threw from a distance, and entangled their enemy in a\n",
      "running noose. In the field, the Sclavonian infantry was dangerous\n",
      "by their speed, agility, and hardiness: they swam, they dived, they\n",
      "remained under water, drawing their breath through a hollow cane; and\n",
      "a river or lake was often the scene of their unsuspected ambuscade. But\n",
      "these were the achievements of spies or stragglers; the military art was\n",
      "unknown to the Sclavonians; their name was obscure, and their conquests\n",
      "were inglorious.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have marked the faint and general outline of the Sclavonians and\n",
      "Bulgarians, without attempting to define their intermediate boundaries,\n",
      "which were not accurately known or respected by the Barbarians\n",
      "themselves. Their importance was measured by their vicinity to the\n",
      "empire; and the level country of Moldavia and Wallachia was occupied\n",
      "by the Antes, a Sclavonian tribe, which swelled the titles of\n",
      "Justinian with an epithet of conquest. Against the Antes he erected the\n",
      "fortifications of the Lower Danube; and labored to secure the alliance\n",
      "of a people seated in the direct channel of northern inundation, an\n",
      "interval of two hundred miles between the mountains of Transylvania and\n",
      "the Euxine Sea. But the Antes wanted power and inclination to stem the\n",
      "fury of the torrent; and the light-armed Sclavonians, from a hundred\n",
      "tribes, pursued with almost equal speed the footsteps of the Bulgarian\n",
      "horse. The payment of one piece of gold for each soldier procured a safe\n",
      "and easy retreat through the country of the GepidÊ, who commanded the\n",
      "passage of the Upper Danube. The hopes or fears of the Barbarians; their\n",
      "intense union or discord; the accident of a frozen or shallow stream;\n",
      "the prospect of harvest or vintage; the prosperity or distress of the\n",
      "Romans; were the causes which produced the uniform repetition of annual\n",
      "visits, tedious in the narrative, and destructive in the event. The same\n",
      "year, and possibly the same month, in which Ravenna surrendered, was\n",
      "marked by an invasion of the Huns or Bulgarians, so dreadful, that it\n",
      "almost effaced the memory of their past inroads. They spread from the\n",
      "suburbs of Constantinople to the Ionian Gulf, destroyed thirty-two\n",
      "cities or castles, erased PotidÊa, which Athens had built, and Philip\n",
      "had besieged, and repassed the Danube, dragging at their horses' heels\n",
      "one hundred and twenty thousand of the subjects of Justinian. In a\n",
      "subsequent inroad they pierced the wall of the Thracian Chersonesus,\n",
      "extirpated the habitations and the inhabitants, boldly traversed the\n",
      "Hellespont, and returned to their companions, laden with the spoils of\n",
      "Asia. Another party, which seemed a multitude in the eyes of the Romans,\n",
      "penetrated, without opposition, from the Straits of ThermopylÊ to the\n",
      "Isthmus of Corinth; and the last ruin of Greece has appeared an object\n",
      "too minute for the attention of history. The works which the emperor\n",
      "raised for the protection, but at the expense of his subjects, served\n",
      "only to disclose the weakness of some neglected part; and the walls,\n",
      "which by flattery had been deemed impregnable, were either deserted by\n",
      "the garrison, or scaled by the Barbarians. Three thousand Sclavonians,\n",
      "who insolently divided themselves into two bands, discovered the\n",
      "weakness and misery of a triumphant reign. They passed the Danube and\n",
      "the Hebrus, vanquished the Roman generals who dared to oppose their\n",
      "progress, and plundered, with impunity, the cities of Illyricum\n",
      "and Thrace, each of which had arms and numbers to overwhelm their\n",
      "contemptible assailants. Whatever praise the boldness of the Sclavonians\n",
      "may deserve, it is sullied by the wanton and deliberate cruelty which\n",
      "they are accused of exercising on their prisoners. Without distinction\n",
      "of rank, or age, or sex, the captives were impaled or flayed alive, or\n",
      "suspended between four posts, and beaten with clubs till they expired,\n",
      "or enclosed in some spacious building, and left to perish in the flames\n",
      "with the spoil and cattle which might impede the march of these savage\n",
      "victors. Perhaps a more impartial narrative would reduce the number, and\n",
      "qualify the nature, of these horrid acts; and they might sometimes be\n",
      "excused by the cruel laws of retaliation. In the siege of Topirus, whose\n",
      "obstinate defence had enraged the Sclavonians, they massacred fifteen\n",
      "thousand males; but they spared the women and children; the most\n",
      "valuable captives were always reserved for labor or ransom; the\n",
      "servitude was not rigorous, and the terms of their deliverance were\n",
      "speedy and moderate. But the subject, or the historian of Justinian,\n",
      "exhaled his just indignation in the language of complaint and reproach;\n",
      "and Procopius has confidently affirmed, that in a reign of thirty-two\n",
      "years, each annual inroad of the Barbarians consumed two hundred\n",
      "thousand of the inhabitants of the Roman empire. The entire population\n",
      "of Turkish Europe, which nearly corresponds with the provinces of\n",
      "Justinian, would perhaps be incapable of supplying six millions of\n",
      "persons, the result of this incredible estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of these obscure calamities, Europe felt the shock of\n",
      "revolution, which first revealed to the world the name and nation of the\n",
      "Turks. Like Romulus, the founder of that martial people was suckled\n",
      "by a she-wolf, who afterwards made him the father of a numerous progeny;\n",
      "and the representation of that animal in the banners of the Turks\n",
      "preserved the memory, or rather suggested the idea, of a fable, which\n",
      "was invented, without any mutual intercourse, by the shepherds of Latium\n",
      "and those of Scythia. At the equal distance of two thousand miles from\n",
      "the Caspian, the Icy, the Chinese, and the Bengal Seas, a ridge of\n",
      "mountains is conspicuous, the centre, and perhaps the summit, of Asia;\n",
      "which, in the language of different nations, has been styled Imaus, and\n",
      "Caf, and Altai, and the Golden Mountains, and the Girdle of the Earth.\n",
      "The sides of the hills were productive of minerals; and the iron forges,\n",
      "for the purpose of war, were exercised by the Turks, the most despised\n",
      "portion of the slaves of the great khan of the Geougen. But their\n",
      "servitude could only last till a leader, bold and eloquent, should arise\n",
      "to persuade his countrymen that the same arms which they forged for\n",
      "their masters, might become, in their own hands, the instruments of\n",
      "freedom and victory. They sallied from the mountains; a sceptre was the\n",
      "reward of his advice; and the annual ceremony, in which a piece of iron\n",
      "was heated in the fire, and a smith's hammer was successively handled\n",
      "by the prince and his nobles, recorded for ages the humble profession\n",
      "and rational pride of the Turkish nation. Bertezena, their first leader,\n",
      "signalized their valor and his own in successful combats against the\n",
      "neighboring tribes; but when he presumed to ask in marriage the daughter\n",
      "of the great khan, the insolent demand of a slave and a mechanic was\n",
      "contemptuously rejected. The disgrace was expiated by a more noble\n",
      "alliance with a princess of China; and the decisive battle which almost\n",
      "extirpated the nation of the Geougen, established in Tartary the new and\n",
      "more powerful empire of the Turks. They reigned over the north; but\n",
      "they confessed the vanity of conquest, by their faithful attachment to\n",
      "the mountain of their fathers. The royal encampment seldom lost sight\n",
      "of Mount Altai, from whence the River Irtish descends to water the rich\n",
      "pastures of the Calmucks, which nourish the largest sheep and oxen in\n",
      "the world. The soil is fruitful, and the climate mild and temperate: the\n",
      "happy region was ignorant of earthquake and pestilence; the emperor's\n",
      "throne was turned towards the East, and a golden wolf on the top of a\n",
      "spear seemed to guard the entrance of his tent. One of the successors of\n",
      "Bertezena was tempted by the luxury and superstition of China; but his\n",
      "design of building cities and temples was defeated by the simple wisdom\n",
      "of a Barbarian counsellor. \"The Turks,\" he said, \"are not equal in\n",
      "number to one hundredth part of the inhabitants of China. If we balance\n",
      "their power, and elude their armies, it is because we wander without any\n",
      "fixed habitations in the exercise of war and hunting. Are we strong? we\n",
      "advance and conquer: are we feeble? we retire and are concealed. Should\n",
      "the Turks confine themselves within the walls of cities, the loss of a\n",
      "battle would be the destruction of their empire. The bonzes preach only\n",
      "patience, humility, and the renunciation of the world. Such, O king! is\n",
      "not the religion of heroes.\" They entertained, with less reluctance, the\n",
      "doctrines of Zoroaster; but the greatest part of the nation acquiesced,\n",
      "without inquiry, in the opinions, or rather in the practice, of their\n",
      "ancestors. The honors of sacrifice were reserved for the supreme deity;\n",
      "they acknowledged, in rude hymns, their obligations to the air, the\n",
      "fire, the water, and the earth; and their priests derived some profit\n",
      "from the art of divination. Their unwritten laws were rigorous and\n",
      "impartial: theft was punished with a tenfold restitution; adultery,\n",
      "treason, and murder, with death; and no chastisement could be inflicted\n",
      "too severe for the rare and inexpiable guilt of cowardice. As the\n",
      "subject nations marched under the standard of the Turks, their cavalry,\n",
      "both men and horses, were proudly computed by millions; one of their\n",
      "effective armies consisted of four hundred thousand soldiers, and in\n",
      "less than fifty years they were connected in peace and war with the\n",
      "Romans, the Persians, and the Chinese. In their northern limits, some\n",
      "vestige may be discovered of the form and situation of Kamptchatka, of\n",
      "a people of hunters and fishermen, whose sledges were drawn by dogs, and\n",
      "whose habitations were buried in the earth. The Turks were ignorant of\n",
      "astronomy; but the observation taken by some learned Chinese, with a\n",
      "gnomon of eight feet, fixes the royal camp in the latitude of forty-nine\n",
      "degrees, and marks their extreme progress within three, or at least ten\n",
      "degrees, of the polar circle. Among their southern conquests the most\n",
      "splendid was that of the Nephthalites, or white Huns, a polite and\n",
      "warlike people, who possessed the commercial cities of Bochara and\n",
      "Samarcand, who had vanquished the Persian monarch, and carried their\n",
      "victorious arms along the banks, and perhaps to the mouth, of the\n",

      "history of the times, that they mowed down their patient enemies like\n",
      "hemp or grass; and that the mandarins applauded the wisdom of an emperor\n",

      "In the rapid career of conquest, the Turks attacked and subdued the\n",
      "nation of the Ogors or Varchonites on the banks of the River Til,\n",
      "which derived the epithet of Black from its dark water or gloomy\n",
      "forests. The khan of the Ogors was slain with three hundred thousand\n",
      "of his subjects, and their bodies were scattered over the space of four\n",
      "days' journey: their surviving countrymen acknowledged the strength and\n",
      "mercy of the Turks; and a small portion, about twenty thousand warriors,\n",
      "preferred exile to servitude. They followed the well-known road of the\n",
      "Volga, cherished the error of the nations who confounded them with the\n",
      "Avars, and spread the terror of that false though famous appellation,\n",
      "which had not, however, saved its lawful proprietors from the yoke of\n",
      "the Turks. After a long and victorious march, the new Avars arrived at\n",
      "the foot of Mount Caucasus, in the country of the Alani and Circassians,\n",
      "where they first heard of the splendor and weakness of the Roman empire.\n",
      "They humbly requested their confederate, the prince of the Alani, to\n",
      "lead them to this source of riches; and their ambassador, with the\n",
      "permission of the governor of Lazica, was transported by the Euxine\n",
      "Sea to Constantinople. The whole city was poured forth to behold with\n",
      "curiosity and terror the aspect of a strange people: their long hair,\n",
      "which hung in tresses down their backs, was gracefully bound with\n",
      "ribbons, but the rest of their habit appeared to imitate the fashion of\n",
      "the Huns. When they were admitted to the audience of Justinian, Candish,\n",
      "the first of the ambassadors, addressed the Roman emperor in these\n",
      "terms: \"You see before you, O mighty prince, the representatives of the\n",
      "strongest and most populous of nations, the invincible, the irresistible\n",
      "Avars. We are willing to devote ourselves to your service: we are able\n",
      "to vanquish and destroy all the enemies who now disturb your repose.\n",
      "But we expect, as the price of our alliance, as the reward of our valor,\n",
      "precious gifts, annual subsidies, and fruitful possessions.\" At the time\n",
      "of this embassy, Justinian had reigned above thirty, he had lived\n",
      "above seventy-five years: his mind, as well as his body, was feeble\n",
      "and languid; and the conqueror of Africa and Italy, careless of the\n",
      "permanent interest of his people, aspired only to end his days in the\n",
      "bosom even of inglorious peace. In a studied oration, he imparted to\n",
      "the senate his resolution to dissemble the insult, and to purchase the\n",
      "friendship of the Avars; and the whole senate, like the mandarins\n",
      "of China, applauded the incomparable wisdom and foresight of their\n",
      "sovereign. The instruments of luxury were immediately prepared to\n",
      "captivate the Barbarians; silken garments, soft and splendid beds, and\n",
      "chains and collars incrusted with gold. The ambassadors, content with\n",
      "such liberal reception, departed from Constantinople, and Valentin, one\n",
      "of the emperor's guards, was sent with a similar character to their camp\n",
      "at the foot of Mount Caucasus. As their destruction or their success\n",
      "must be alike advantageous to the empire, he persuaded them to invade\n",
      "the enemies of Rome; and they were easily tempted, by gifts and\n",
      "promises, to gratify their ruling inclinations. These fugitives, who\n",
      "fled before the Turkish arms, passed the Tanais and Borysthenes, and\n",
      "boldly advanced into the heart of Poland and Germany, violating the\n",
      "law of nations, and abusing the rights of victory. Before ten years\n",
      "had elapsed, their camps were seated on the Danube and the Elbe, many\n",
      "Bulgarian and Sclavonian names were obliterated from the earth, and the\n",
      "remainder of their tribes are found, as tributaries and vassals, under\n",
      "the standard of the Avars. The chagan, the peculiar title of their king,\n",
      "still affected to cultivate the friendship of the emperor; and Justinian\n",
      "entertained some thoughts of fixing them in Pannonia, to balance the\n",
      "prevailing power of the Lombards. But the virtue or treachery of an Avar\n",
      "betrayed the secret enmity and ambitious designs of their countrymen;\n",
      "and they loudly complained of the timid, though jealous policy, of\n",
      "detaining their ambassadors, and denying the arms which they had been\n",
      "allowed to purchase in the capital of the empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the apparent change in the dispositions of the emperors may be\n",
      "ascribed to the embassy which was received from the conquerors of the\n",
      "Avars. The immense distance which eluded their arms could not extinguish\n",
      "their resentment: the Turkish ambassadors pursued the footsteps of\n",
      "the vanquished to the Jaik, the Volga, Mount Caucasus, the Euxine\n",
      "and Constantinople, and at length appeared before the successor of\n",
      "Constantine, to request that he would not espouse the cause of\n",
      "rebels and fugitives. Even commerce had some share in this remarkable\n",
      "negotiation: and the Sogdoites, who were now the tributaries of the\n",
      "Turks, embraced the fair occasion of opening, by the north of the\n",
      "Caspian, a new road for the importation of Chinese silk into the Roman\n",
      "empire. The Persian, who preferred the navigation of Ceylon, had stopped\n",
      "the caravans of Bochara and Samarcand: their silk was contemptuously\n",
      "burnt: some Turkish ambassadors died in Persia, with a suspicion of\n",
      "poison; and the great khan permitted his faithful vassal Maniach, the\n",
      "prince of the Sogdoites, to propose, at the Byzantine court, a treaty of\n",
      "alliance against their common enemies. Their splendid apparel and rich\n",
      "presents, the fruit of Oriental luxury, distinguished Maniach and his\n",
      "colleagues from the rude savages of the North: their letters, in the\n",
      "Scythian character and language, announced a people who had attained the\n",
      "rudiments of science: they enumerated the conquests, they offered\n",
      "the friendship and military aid of the Turks; and their sincerity was\n",
      "attested by direful imprecations (if they were guilty of falsehood)\n",
      "against their own head, and the head of Disabul their master. The Greek\n",
      "prince entertained with hospitable regard the ambassadors of a remote\n",
      "and powerful monarch: the sight of silk-worms and looms disappointed the\n",
      "hopes of the Sogdoites; the emperor renounced, or seemed to renounce,\n",
      "the fugitive Avars, but he accepted the alliance of the Turks; and the\n",
      "ratification of the treaty was carried by a Roman minister to the foot\n",
      "of Mount Altai. Under the successors of Justinian, the friendship of the\n",
      "two nations was cultivated by frequent and cordial intercourse; the most\n",
      "favored vassals were permitted to imitate the example of the great khan,\n",
      "and one hundred and six Turks, who, on various occasions, had visited\n",
      "Constantinople, departed at the same time for their native country. The\n",
      "duration and length of the journey from the Byzantine court to Mount\n",
      "Altai are not specified: it might have been difficult to mark a road\n",
      "through the nameless deserts, the mountains, rivers, and morasses of\n",
      "Tartary; but a curious account has been preserved of the reception of\n",
      "the Roman ambassadors at the royal camp. After they had been purified\n",
      "with fire and incense, according to a rite still practised under the\n",
      "sons of Zingis, they were introduced to the presence of Disabul. In\n",
      "a valley of the Golden Mountain, they found the great khan in his tent,\n",
      "seated in a chair with wheels, to which a horse might be occasionally\n",
      "harnessed. As soon as they had delivered their presents, which were\n",
      "received by the proper officers, they exposed, in a florid oration, the\n",
      "wishes of the Roman emperor, that victory might attend the arms of the\n",
      "Turks, that their reign might be long and prosperous, and that a strict\n",
      "alliance, without envy or deceit, might forever be maintained between\n",
      "the two most powerful nations of the earth. The answer of Disabul\n",
      "corresponded with these friendly professions, and the ambassadors were\n",
      "seated by his side, at a banquet which lasted the greatest part of the\n",
      "day: the tent was surrounded with silk hangings, and a Tartar liquor was\n",
      "served on the table, which possessed at least the intoxicating qualities\n",
      "of wine. The entertainment of the succeeding day was more sumptuous; the\n",
      "silk hangings of the second tent were embroidered in various figures;\n",
      "and the royal seat, the cups, and the vases, were of gold. A third\n",
      "pavilion was supported by columns of gilt wood; a bed of pure and massy\n",
      "gold was raised on four peacocks of the same metal: and before the\n",
      "entrance of the tent, dishes, basins, and statues of solid silver, and\n",
      "admirable art, were ostentatiously piled in wagons, the monuments of\n",
      "valor rather than of industry. When Disabul led his armies against the\n",
      "frontiers of Persia, his Roman allies followed many days the march of\n",
      "the Turkish camp, nor were they dismissed till they had enjoyed their\n",
      "precedency over the envoy of the great king, whose loud and intemperate\n",
      "clamors interrupted the silence of the royal banquet. The power and\n",
      "ambition of Chosroes cemented the union of the Turks and Romans,\n",
      "who touched his dominions on either side: but those distant nations,\n",
      "regardless of each other, consulted the dictates of interest, without\n",
      "recollecting the obligations of oaths and treaties. While the successor\n",
      "of Disabul celebrated his father's obsequies, he was saluted by the\n",
      "ambassadors of the emperor Tiberius, who proposed an invasion of Persia,\n",
      "and sustained, with firmness, the angry and perhaps the just reproaches\n",
      "of that haughty Barbarian. \"You see my ten fingers,\" said the great\n",
      "khan, and he applied them to his mouth. \"You Romans speak with as many\n",
      "tongues, but they are tongues of deceit and perjury. To me you hold\n",
      "one language, to my subjects another; and the nations are successively\n",
      "deluded by your perfidious eloquence. You precipitate your allies\n",
      "into war and danger, you enjoy their labors, and you neglect your\n",
      "benefactors. Hasten your return, inform your master that a Turk is\n",
      "incapable of uttering or forgiving falsehood, and that he shall speedily\n",
      "meet the punishment which he deserves. While he solicits my friendship\n",
      "with flattering and hollow words, he is sunk to a confederate of\n",
      "my fugitive Varchonites. If I condescend to march against those\n",
      "contemptible slaves, they will tremble at the sound of our whips; they\n",
      "will be trampled, like a nest of ants, under the feet of my innumerable\n",
      "cavalry. I am not ignorant of the road which they have followed to\n",
      "invade your empire; nor can I be deceived by the vain pretence, that\n",
      "Mount Caucasus is the impregnable barrier of the Romans. I know the\n",
      "course of the Niester, the Danube, and the Hebrus; the most warlike\n",
      "nations have yielded to the arms of the Turks; and from the rising to\n",
      "the setting sun, the earth is my inheritance.\" Notwithstanding this\n",
      "menace, a sense of mutual advantage soon renewed the alliance of\n",
      "the Turks and Romans: but the pride of the great khan survived his\n",
      "resentment; and when he announced an important conquest to his friend\n",
      "the emperor Maurice, he styled himself the master of the seven races,\n",
      "and the lord of the seven climates of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disputes have often arisen between the sovereigns of Asia for the title\n",
      "of king of the world; while the contest has proved that it could not\n",
      "belong to either of the competitors. The kingdom of the Turks was\n",
      "bounded by the Oxus or Gihon; and _Touran_ was separated by that great\n",
      "river from the rival monarchy of _Iran_, or Persia, which in a smaller\n",
      "compass contained perhaps a larger measure of power and population. The\n",
      "Persians, who alternately invaded and repulsed the Turks and the Romans,\n",
      "were still ruled by the house of Sassan, which ascended the throne\n",
      "three hundred years before the accession of Justinian. His contemporary,\n",
      "Cabades, or Kobad, had been successful in war against the emperor\n",
      "Anastasius; but the reign of that prince was distracted by civil and\n",
      "religious troubles. A prisoner in the hands of his subjects, an exile\n",
      "among the enemies of Persia, he recovered his liberty by prostituting\n",
      "the honor of his wife, and regained his kingdom with the dangerous and\n",
      "mercenary aid of the Barbarians, who had slain his father. His nobles\n",
      "were suspicious that Kobad never forgave the authors of his expulsion,\n",
      "or even those of his restoration. The people was deluded and inflamed by\n",
      "the fanaticism of Mazdak, who asserted the community of women, and the\n",
      "equality of mankind, whilst he appropriated the richest lands and\n",
      "most beautiful females to the use of his sectaries. The view of these\n",
      "disorders, which had been fomented by his laws and example, imbittered\n",
      "the declining age of the Persian monarch; and his fears were increased\n",
      "by the consciousness of his design to reverse the natural and customary\n",
      "order of succession, in favor of his third and most favored son, so\n",
      "famous under the names of Chosroes and Nushirvan. To render the youth\n",
      "more illustrious in the eyes of the nations, Kobad was desirous that he\n",
      "should be adopted by the emperor Justin: the hope of peace inclined\n",
      "the Byzantine court to accept this singular proposal; and Chosroes might\n",
      "have acquired a specious claim to the inheritance of his Roman parent.\n",
      "But the future mischief was diverted by the advice of the quÊstor\n",
      "Proclus: a difficulty was started, whether the adoption should\n",
      "be performed as a civil or military rite; the treaty was abruptly\n",
      "dissolved; and the sense of this indignity sunk deep into the mind\n",
      "of Chosroes, who had already advanced to the Tigris on his road to\n",
      "Constantinople. His father did not long survive the disappointment of\n",
      "his wishes: the testament of their deceased sovereign was read in the\n",
      "assembly of the nobles; and a powerful faction, prepared for the event,\n",
      "and regardless of the priority of age, exalted Chosroes to the throne of\n",
      "Persia. He filled that throne during a prosperous period of forty-eight\n",
      "years; and the Justice of Nushirvan is celebrated as the theme of\n",
      "immortal praise by the nations of the East.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the justice of kings is understood by themselves, and even by their\n",
      "subjects, with an ample indulgence for the gratification of passion and\n",
      "interest. The virtue of Chosroes was that of a conqueror, who, in the\n",
      "measures of peace and war, is excited by ambition, and restrained by\n",
      "prudence; who confounds the greatness with the happiness of a nation,\n",
      "and calmly devotes the lives of thousands to the fame, or even the\n",
      "amusement, of a single man. In his domestic administration, the just\n",
      "Nushirvan would merit in our feelings the appellation of a tyrant. His\n",
      "two elder brothers had been deprived of their fair expectations of the\n",
      "diadem: their future life, between the supreme rank and the condition of\n",
      "subjects, was anxious to themselves and formidable to their master: fear\n",
      "as well as revenge might tempt them to rebel: the slightest evidence\n",
      "of a conspiracy satisfied the author of their wrongs; and the repose of\n",
      "Chosroes was secured by the death of these unhappy princes, with their\n",
      "families and adherents. One guiltless youth was saved and dismissed by\n",
      "the compassion of a veteran general; and this act of humanity, which was\n",
      "revealed by his son, overbalanced the merit of reducing twelve nations\n",
      "to the obedience of Persia. The zeal and prudence of Mebodes had fixed\n",
      "the diadem on the head of Chosroes himself; but he delayed to attend the\n",
      "royal summons, till he had performed the duties of a military review: he\n",
      "was instantly commanded to repair to the iron tripod, which stood before\n",
      "the gate of the palace, where it was death to relieve or approach the\n",
      "victim; and Mebodes languished several days before his sentence was\n",
      "pronounced, by the inflexible pride and calm ingratitude of the son\n",
      "of Kobad. But the people, more especially in the East, is disposed to\n",
      "forgive, and even to applaud, the cruelty which strikes at the loftiest\n",
      "heads; at the slaves of ambition, whose voluntary choice has exposed\n",
      "them to live in the smiles, and to perish by the frown, of a capricious\n",
      "monarch. In the execution of the laws which he had no temptation to\n",
      "violate; in the punishment of crimes which attacked his own dignity, as\n",
      "well as the happiness of individuals; Nushirvan, or Chosroes, deserved\n",
      "the appellation of _just_. His government was firm, rigorous, and\n",
      "impartial. It was the first labor of his reign to abolish the dangerous\n",
      "theory of common or equal possessions: the lands and women which the\n",
      "sectaries of Mazdak has usurped were restored to their lawful owners;\n",
      "and the temperate chastisement of the fanatics or impostors confirmed\n",
      "the domestic rights of society. Instead of listening with blind\n",
      "confidence to a favorite minister, he established four viziers over\n",
      "the four great provinces of his empire, Assyria, Media, Persia, and\n",
      "Bactriana. In the choice of judges, prÊfects, and counsellors, he strove\n",
      "to remove the mask which is always worn in the presence of kings: he\n",
      "wished to substitute the natural order of talents for the accidental\n",
      "distinctions of birth and fortune; he professed, in specious language,\n",
      "his intention to prefer those men who carried the poor in their bosoms,\n",
      "and to banish corruption from the seat of justice, as dogs were excluded\n",
      "from the temples of the Magi. The code of laws of the first Artaxerxes\n",
      "was revived and published as the rule of the magistrates; but the\n",
      "assurance of speedy punishment was the best security of their virtue.\n",
      "Their behavior was inspected by a thousand eyes, their words were\n",
      "overheard by a thousand ears, the secret or public agents of the\n",
      "throne; and the provinces, from the Indian to the Arabian confines,\n",
      "were enlightened by the frequent visits of a sovereign, who affected\n",
      "to emulate his celestial brother in his rapid and salutary career.\n",
      "Education and agriculture he viewed as the two objects most deserving of\n",
      "his care. In every city of Persia orphans, and the children of the poor,\n",
      "were maintained and instructed at the public expense; the daughters were\n",
      "given in marriage to the richest citizens of their own rank, and the\n",
      "sons, according to their different talents, were employed in mechanic\n",
      "trades, or promoted to more honorable service. The deserted villages\n",
      "were relieved by his bounty; to the peasants and farmers who were found\n",
      "incapable of cultivating their lands, he distributed cattle, seed, and\n",
      "the instruments of husbandry; and the rare and inestimable treasure of\n",
      "fresh water was parsimoniously managed, and skilfully dispersed over the\n",
      "arid territory of Persia. The prosperity of that kingdom was the effect\n",
      "and evidence of his virtues; his vices are those of Oriental despotism;\n",
      "but in the long competition between Chosroes and Justinian, the\n",
      "advantage both of merit and fortune is almost always on the side of the\n",
      "Barbarian.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the praise of justice Nushirvan united the reputation of knowledge;\n",
      "and the seven Greek philosophers, who visited his court, were invited\n",
      "and deceived by the strange assurance, that a disciple of Plato\n",
      "was seated on the Persian throne. Did they expect, that a prince,\n",
      "strenuously exercised in the toils of war and government, should\n",
      "agitate, with dexterity like their own, the abstruse and profound\n",
      "questions which amused the leisure of the schools of Athens? Could they\n",
      "hope that the precepts of philosophy should direct the life, and control\n",
      "the passions, of a despot, whose infancy had been taught to consider his\n",
      "absolute and fluctuating will as the only rule of moral obligation? The\n",
      "studies of Chosroes were ostentatious and superficial: but his example\n",
      "awakened the curiosity of an ingenious people, and the light of science\n",
      "was diffused over the dominions of Persia. At Gondi Sapor, in the\n",
      "neighborhood of the royal city of Susa, an academy of physic was\n",
      "founded, which insensibly became a liberal school of poetry, philosophy,\n",
      "and rhetoric. The annals of the monarchy were composed; and while recent\n",
      "and authentic history might afford some useful lessons both to the\n",
      "prince and people, the darkness of the first ages was embellished by the\n",
      "giants, the dragons, and the fabulous heroes of Oriental romance. Every\n",
      "learned or confident stranger was enriched by the bounty, and flattered\n",
      "by the conversation, of the monarch: he nobly rewarded a Greek\n",
      "physician, by the deliverance of three thousand, captives; and the\n",
      "sophists, who contended for his favor, were exasperated by the wealth\n",
      "and insolence of Uranius, their more successful rival. Nushirvan\n",
      "believed, or at least respected, the religion of the Magi; and some\n",
      "traces of persecution may be discovered in his reign. Yet he allowed\n",
      "himself freely to compare the tenets of the various sects; and the\n",
      "theological disputes, in which he frequently presided, diminished the\n",
      "authority of the priest, and enlightened the minds of the people. At his\n",
      "command, the most celebrated writers of Greece and India were translated\n",
      "into the Persian language; a smooth and elegant idiom, recommended by\n",
      "Mahomet to the use of paradise; though it is branded with the epithets\n",
      "of savage and unmusical, by the ignorance and presumption of Agathias.\n",
      "Yet the Greek historian might reasonably wonder that it should be\n",
      "found possible to execute an entire version of Plato and Aristotle in\n",
      "a foreign dialect, which had not been framed to express the spirit of\n",

      "despatched to the banks of the Ganges, with instructions to procure,\n",
      "at any price, the communication of this valuable work. His dexterity\n",
      "obtained a transcript, his learned diligence accomplished the\n",
      "translation; and the fables of Pilpay were read and admired in the\n",
      "assembly of Nushirvan and his nobles. The Indian original, and the\n",
      "Persian copy, have long since disappeared; but this venerable monument\n",
      "has been saved by the curiosity of the Arabian caliphs, revived in\n",
      "the modern Persic, the Turkish, the Syriac, the Hebrew, and the Greek\n",
      "idioms, and transfused through successive versions into the modern\n",
      "languages of Europe. In their present form, the peculiar character, the\n",
      "manners and religion of the Hindoos, are completely obliterated; and the\n",
      "intrinsic merit of the fables of Pilpay is far inferior to the concise\n",
      "elegance of PhÊdrus, and the native graces of La Fontaine. Fifteen moral\n",
      "and political sentences are illustrated in a series of apologues: but\n",
      "the composition is intricate, the narrative prolix, and the precept\n",
      "obvious and barren. Yet the Brachman may assume the merit of\n",
      "_inventing_ a pleasing fiction, which adorns the nakedness of truth, and\n",

      "assumed the guard of the gates of Caucasus, and the demolition of Dara\n",
      "was suspended, on condition that it should never be made the residence\n",

      "of Chosroes was soothed by a large portion of the spoils of Carthage,\n",

      "of violating treaties, he secretly excited his bold and subtle vassal\n",
      "Almondar. That prince of the Saracens, who resided at Hira, had not been\n",
      "included in the general peace, and still waged an obscure war against\n",
      "his rival Arethas, the chief of the tribe of Gassan, and confederate of\n",
      "the empire. The subject of their dispute was an extensive sheep-walk\n",
      "in the desert to the south of Palmyra. An immemorial tribute for the\n",

      "the Persian Arab, without expecting the event of a slow and doubtful\n",
      "arbitration, enriched his flying camp with the spoil and captives of\n",
      "Syria. Instead of repelling the arms, Justinian attempted to seduce the\n",
      "fidelity of Almondar, while he called from the extremities of the earth\n",
      "the nations of ∆thiopia and Scythia to invade the dominions of his\n",
      "rival. But the aid of such allies was distant and precarious, and the\n",

      "had secretly traversed the empire to expose the instant, and almost\n",
      "inevitable, danger of the kingdom of Italy. Their representations were\n",
      "uniform, weighty, and effectual. \"We stand before your throne, the\n",
      "advocates of your interest as well as of our own. The ambitious and\n",
      "faithless Justinian aspires to be the sole master of the world. Since\n",
      "the endless peace, which betrayed the common freedom of mankind, that\n",
      "prince, your ally in words, your enemy in actions, has alike insulted\n",
      "his friends and foes, and has filled the earth with blood and confusion.\n",
      "Has he not violated the privileges of Armenia, the independence of\n",
      "Colchos, and the wild liberty of the Tzanian mountains? Has he not\n",
      "usurped, with equal avidity, the city of Bosphorus on the frozen MÊotis,\n",
      "and the vale of palm-trees on the shores of the Red Sea? The Moors, the\n",
      "Vandals, the Goths, have been successively oppressed, and each nation\n",
      "has calmly remained the spectator of their neighbor's ruin. Embrace, O\n",
      "king! the favorable moment; the East is left without defence, while the\n",
      "armies of Justinian and his renowned general are detained in the distant\n",

      "Persia may enjoy the wretched consolation of being the last devoured.\"\n",
      "By such arguments, Chosroes was easily persuaded to imitate the example\n",
      "which he condemned: but the Persian, ambitious of military fame,\n",
      "disdained the inactive warfare of a rival, who issued his sanguinary\n",
      "commands from the secure station of the Byzantine palace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever might be the provocations of Chosroes, he abused the confidence\n",
      "of treaties; and the just reproaches of dissimulation and falsehood\n",
      "could only be concealed by the lustre of his victories. The Persian\n",
      "army, which had been assembled in the plains of Babylon, prudently\n",
      "declined the strong cities of Mesopotamia, and followed the western\n",
      "bank of the Euphrates, till the small, though populous, town of Dura\n",
      "presumed to arrest the progress of the great king. The gates of Dura,\n",
      "by treachery and surprise, were burst open; and as soon as Chosroes had\n",
      "stained his cimeter with the blood of the inhabitants, he dismissed the\n",
      "ambassador of Justinian to inform his master in what place he had left\n",
      "the enemy of the Romans. The conqueror still affected the praise of\n",
      "humanity and justice; and as he beheld a noble matron with her infant\n",
      "rudely dragged along the ground, he sighed, he wept, and implored the\n",
      "divine justice to punish the author of these calamities. Yet the herd\n",
      "of twelve thousand captives was ransomed for two hundred pounds of gold;\n",
      "the neighboring bishop of Sergiopolis pledged his faith for the payment:\n",
      "and in the subsequent year the unfeeling avarice of Chosroes exacted\n",
      "the penalty of an obligation which it was generous to contract and\n",
      "impossible to discharge. He advanced into the heart of Syria: but a\n",
      "feeble enemy, who vanished at his approach, disappointed him of the\n",
      "honor of victory; and as he could not hope to establish his dominion,\n",
      "the Persian king displayed in this inroad the mean and rapacious vices\n",
      "of a robber. Hierapolis, BerrhÊa or Aleppo, Apamea and Chalcis, were\n",
      "successively besieged: they redeemed their safety by a ransom of gold\n",
      "or silver, proportioned to their respective strength and opulence; and\n",
      "their new master enforced, without observing, the terms of capitulation.\n",
      "Educated in the religion of the Magi, he exercised, without remorse, the\n",
      "lucrative trade of sacrilege; and, after stripping of its gold and gems\n",
      "a piece of the true cross, he generously restored the naked relic to the\n",
      "devotion of the Christians of Apamea. No more than fourteen years had\n",
      "elapsed since Antioch was ruined by an earthquake; but the queen of\n",
      "the East, the new Theopolis, had been raised from the ground by the\n",
      "liberality of Justinian; and the increasing greatness of the buildings\n",
      "and the people already erased the memory of this recent disaster. On one\n",
      "side, the city was defended by the mountain, on the other by the River\n",
      "Orontes; but the most accessible part was commanded by a superior\n",
      "eminence: the proper remedies were rejected, from the despicable fear\n",
      "of discovering its weakness to the enemy; and Germanus, the emperor's\n",
      "nephew, refused to trust his person and dignity within the walls of\n",
      "a besieged city. The people of Antioch had inherited the vain and\n",
      "satirical genius of their ancestors: they were elated by a sudden\n",
      "reÎnforcement of six thousand soldiers; they disdained the offers of\n",
      "an easy capitulation and their intemperate clamors insulted from the\n",
      "ramparts the majesty of the great king. Under his eye the Persian\n",
      "myriads mounted with scaling-ladders to the assault; the Roman\n",
      "mercenaries fled through the opposite gate of Daphne; and the generous\n",
      "assistance of the youth of Antioch served only to aggravate the miseries\n",
      "of their country. As Chosroes, attended by the ambassadors of Justinian,\n",
      "was descending from the mountain, he affected, in a plaintive voice, to\n",
      "deplore the obstinacy and ruin of that unhappy people; but the slaughter\n",
      "still raged with unrelenting fury; and the city, at the command of a\n",
      "Barbarian, was delivered to the flames. The cathedral of Antioch was\n",
      "indeed preserved by the avarice, not the piety, of the conqueror: a more\n",
      "honorable exemption was granted to the church of St. Julian, and the\n",
      "quarter of the town where the ambassadors resided; some distant streets\n",
      "were saved by the shifting of the wind, and the walls still subsisted\n",
      "to protect, and soon to betray, their new inhabitants. Fanaticism had\n",
      "defaced the ornaments of Daphne, but Chosroes breathed a purer air\n",
      "amidst her groves and fountains; and some idolaters in his train might\n",
      "sacrifice with impunity to the nymphs of that elegant retreat. Eighteen\n",
      "miles below Antioch, the River Orontes falls into the Mediterranean. The\n",
      "haughty Persian visited the term of his conquests; and, after bathing\n",
      "alone in the sea, he offered a solemn sacrifice of thanksgiving to the\n",
      "sun, or rather to the Creator of the sun, whom the Magi adored. If this\n",
      "act of superstition offended the prejudices of the Syrians, they were\n",
      "pleased by the courteous and even eager attention with which he assisted\n",
      "at the games of the circus; and as Chosroes had heard that the _blue_\n",
      "faction was espoused by the emperor, his peremptory command secured the\n",
      "victory of the _green_ charioteer. From the discipline of his camp the\n",
      "people derived more solid consolation; and they interceded in vain for\n",
      "the life of a soldier who had too faithfully copied the rapine of the\n",
      "just Nushirvan. At length, fatigued, though unsatiated, with the spoil\n",
      "of Syria, he slowly moved to the Euphrates, formed a temporary bridge\n",
      "in the neighborhood of Barbalissus, and defined the space of three\n",
      "days for the entire passage of his numerous host. After his return,\n",
      "he founded, at the distance of one day's journey from the palace of\n",
      "Ctesiphon, a new city, which perpetuated the joint names of Chosroes\n",
      "and of Antioch. The Syrian captives recognized the form and situation\n",
      "of their native abodes: baths and a stately circus were constructed for\n",
      "their use; and a colony of musicians and charioteers revived in Assyria\n",
      "the pleasures of a Greek capital. By the munificence of the royal\n",
      "founder, a liberal allowance was assigned to these fortunate exiles; and\n",
      "they enjoyed the singular privilege of bestowing freedom on the slaves\n",
      "whom they acknowledged as their kinsmen. Palestine, and the holy wealth\n",
      "of Jerusalem, were the next objects that attracted the ambition, or\n",
      "rather the avarice, of Chosroes. Constantinople, and the palace of the\n",
      "CÊsars, no longer appeared impregnable or remote; and his aspiring fancy\n",
      "already covered Asia Minor with the troops, and the Black Sea with the\n",
      "navies, of Persia.\n",
      "\n",
      "These hopes might have been realized, if the conqueror of Italy had\n",
      "not been seasonably recalled to the defence of the East. While Chosroes\n",
      "pursued his ambitious designs on the coast of the Euxine, Belisarius,\n",
      "at the head of an army without pay or discipline, encamped beyond the\n",
      "Euphrates, within six miles of Nisibis. He meditated, by a skilful\n",
      "operation, to draw the Persians from their impregnable citadel, and\n",
      "improving his advantage in the field, either to intercept their retreat,\n",
      "or perhaps to enter the gates with the flying Barbarians. He advanced\n",
      "one day's journey on the territories of Persia, reduced the fortress of\n",
      "Sisaurane, and sent the governor, with eight hundred chosen horsemen,\n",
      "to serve the emperor in his Italian wars. He detached Arethas and his\n",
      "Arabs, supported by twelve hundred Romans, to pass the Tigris, and to\n",
      "ravage the harvests of Assyria, a fruitful province, long exempt from\n",
      "the calamities of war. But the plans of Belisarius were disconcerted by\n",
      "the untractable spirit of Arethas, who neither returned to the camp,\n",
      "nor sent any intelligence of his motions. The Roman general was fixed\n",
      "in anxious expectation to the same spot; the time of action elapsed, the\n",
      "ardent sun of Mesopotamia inflamed with fevers the blood of his European\n",
      "soldiers; and the stationary troops and officers of Syria affected to\n",
      "tremble for the safety of their defenceless cities. Yet this diversion\n",
      "had already succeeded in forcing Chosroes to return with loss and\n",
      "precipitation; and if the skill of Belisarius had been seconded by\n",
      "discipline and valor, his success might have satisfied the sanguine\n",
      "wishes of the public, who required at his hands the conquest of\n",
      "Ctesiphon, and the deliverance of the captives of Antioch. At the end of\n",
      "the campaign, he was recalled to Constantinople by an ungrateful court,\n",
      "but the dangers of the ensuing spring restored his confidence and\n",
      "command; and the hero, almost alone, was despatched, with the speed of\n",
      "post-horses, to repel, by his name and presence, the invasion of Syria.\n",
      "He found the Roman generals, among whom was a nephew of Justinian,\n",
      "imprisoned by their fears in the fortifications of Hierapolis. But\n",
      "instead of listening to their timid counsels, Belisarius commanded them\n",
      "to follow him to Europus, where he had resolved to collect his forces,\n",
      "and to execute whatever God should inspire him to achieve against\n",
      "the enemy. His firm attitude on the banks of the Euphrates restrained\n",
      "Chosroes from advancing towards Palestine; and he received with art and\n",
      "dignity the ambassadors, or rather spies, of the Persian monarch. The\n",
      "plain between Hierapolis and the river was covered with the squadrons of\n",
      "cavalry, six thousand hunters, tall and robust, who pursued their\n",
      "game without the apprehension of an enemy. On the opposite bank the\n",
      "ambassadors descried a thousand Armenian horse, who appeared to guard\n",
      "the passage of the Euphrates. The tent of Belisarius was of the coarsest\n",
      "linen, the simple equipage of a warrior who disdained the luxury of the\n",
      "East. Around his tent, the nations who marched under his standard were\n",
      "arranged with skilful confusion. The Thracians and Illyrians were posted\n",
      "in the front, the Heruli and Goths in the centre; the prospect was\n",
      "closed by the Moors and Vandals, and their loose array seemed to\n",
      "multiply their numbers. Their dress was light and active; one soldier\n",
      "carried a whip, another a sword, a third a bow, a fourth, perhaps,\n",
      "a battle axe, and the whole picture exhibited the intrepidity of the\n",
      "troops and the vigilance of the general. Chosroes was deluded by\n",
      "the address, and awed by the genius, of the lieutenant of Justinian.\n",
      "Conscious of the merit, and ignorant of the force, of his antagonist,\n",
      "he dreaded a decisive battle in a distant country, from whence not\n",
      "a Persian might return to relate the melancholy tale. The great king\n",
      "hastened to repass the Euphrates; and Belisarius pressed his retreat, by\n",
      "affecting to oppose a measure so salutary to the empire, and which could\n",
      "scarcely have been prevented by an army of a hundred thousand men. Envy\n",
      "might suggest to ignorance and pride, that the public enemy had been\n",
      "suffered to escape: but the African and Gothic triumphs are less\n",
      "glorious than this safe and bloodless victory, in which neither fortune,\n",
      "nor the valor of the soldiers, can subtract any part of the general's\n",
      "renown. The second removal of Belisarius from the Persian to the Italian\n",
      "war revealed the extent of his personal merit, which had corrected or\n",
      "supplied the want of discipline and courage. Fifteen generals, without\n",
      "concert or skill, led through the mountains of Armenia an army of thirty\n",
      "thousand Romans, inattentive to their signals, their ranks, and their\n",
      "ensigns. Four thousand Persians, intrenched in the camp of Dubis,\n",
      "vanquished, almost without a combat, this disorderly multitude; their\n",
      "useless arms were scattered along the road, and their horses sunk under\n",
      "the fatigue of their rapid flight. But the Arabs of the Roman party\n",
      "prevailed over their brethren; the Armenians returned to their\n",
      "allegiance; the cities of Dara and Edessa resisted a sudden assault and\n",
      "a regular siege, and the calamities of war were suspended by those\n",
      "of pestilence. A tacit or formal agreement between the two sovereigns\n",
      "protected the tranquillity of the Eastern frontier; and the arms of\n",
      "Chosroes were confined to the Colchian or Lazic war, which has been too\n",
      "minutely described by the historians of the times.\n",
      "\n",
      "The extreme length of the Euxine Sea from Constantinople to the mouth of\n",
      "the Phasis, may be computed as a voyage of nine days, and a measure\n",
      "of seven hundred miles. From the Iberian Caucasus, the most lofty\n",
      "and craggy mountains of Asia, that river descends with such oblique\n",
      "vehemence, that in a short space it is traversed by one hundred and\n",
      "twenty bridges. Nor does the stream become placid and navigable, till it\n",
      "reaches the town of Sarapana, five days' journey from the Cyrus, which\n",
      "flows from the same hills, but in a contrary direction to the Caspian\n",
      "Lake. The proximity of these rivers has suggested the practice, or at\n",
      "least the idea, of wafting the precious merchandise of India down the\n",
      "Oxus, over the Caspian, up the Cyrus, and with the current of the Phasis\n",
      "into the Euxine and Mediterranean Seas. As it successively collects the\n",
      "streams of the plain of Colchos, the Phasis moves with diminished speed,\n",
      "though accumulated weight. At the mouth it is sixty fathom deep, and\n",
      "half a league broad, but a small woody island is interposed in the midst\n",
      "of the channel; the water, so soon as it has deposited an earthy or\n",
      "metallic sediment, floats on the surface of the waves, and is no longer\n",
      "susceptible of corruption. In a course of one hundred miles, forty of\n",
      "which are navigable for large vessels, the Phasis divides the celebrated\n",
      "region of Colchos, or Mingrelia, which, on three sides, is fortified\n",
      "by the Iberian and Armenian mountains, and whose maritime coast extends\n",
      "about two hundred miles from the neighborhood of Trebizond to Dioscurias\n",
      "and the confines of Circassia. Both the soil and climate are relaxed\n",
      "by excessive moisture: twenty-eight rivers, besides the Phasis and his\n",
      "dependent streams, convey their waters to the sea; and the hollowness\n",
      "of the ground appears to indicate the subterraneous channels between the\n",
      "Euxine and the Caspian. In the fields where wheat or barley is sown, the\n",
      "earth is too soft to sustain the action of the plough; but the _gom_,\n",
      "a small grain, not unlike the millet or coriander seed, supplies the\n",
      "ordinary food of the people; and the use of bread is confined to the\n",
      "prince and his nobles. Yet the vintage is more plentiful than the\n",
      "harvest; and the bulk of the stems, as well as the quality of the wine,\n",
      "display the unassisted powers of nature. The same powers continually\n",
      "tend to overshadow the face of the country with thick forests; the\n",
      "timber of the hills, and the flax of the plains, contribute to the\n",
      "abundance of naval stores; the wild and tame animals, the horse, the ox,\n",
      "and the hog, are remarkably prolific, and the name of the pheasant is\n",
      "expressive of his native habitation on the banks of the Phasis. The gold\n",
      "mines to the south of Trebizond, which are still worked with sufficient\n",
      "profit, were a subject of national dispute between Justinian and\n",
      "Chosroes; and it is not unreasonable to believe, that a vein of precious\n",
      "metal may be equally diffused through the circle of the hills, although\n",
      "these secret treasures are neglected by the laziness, or concealed by\n",
      "the prudence, of the Mingrelians. The waters, impregnated with particles\n",
      "of gold, are carefully strained through sheep-skins or fleeces; but this\n",
      "expedient, the groundwork perhaps of a marvellous fable, affords a\n",
      "faint image of the wealth extracted from a virgin earth by the power\n",
      "and industry of ancient kings. Their silver palaces and golden chambers\n",
      "surpass our belief; but the fame of their riches is said to have excited\n",
      "the enterprising avarice of the Argonauts. Tradition has affirmed, with\n",
      "some color of reason, that Egypt planted on the Phasis a learned and\n",
      "polite colony, which manufactured linen, built navies, and invented\n",
      "geographical maps. The ingenuity of the moderns has peopled, with\n",
      "flourishing cities and nations, the isthmus between the Euxine and the\n",
      "Caspian; and a lively writer, observing the resemblance of climate, and,\n",
      "in his apprehension, of trade, has not hesitated to pronounce Colchos\n",
      "the Holland of antiquity.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the riches of Colchos shine only through the darkness of conjecture\n",
      "or tradition; and its genuine history presents a uniform scene of\n",
      "rudeness and poverty. If one hundred and thirty languages were spoken\n",
      "in the market of Dioscurias, they were the imperfect idioms of so many\n",
      "savage tribes or families, sequestered from each other in the valleys of\n",
      "Mount Caucasus; and their separation, which diminished the importance,\n",
      "must have multiplied the number, of their rustic capitals. In the\n",
      "present state of Mingrelia, a village is an assemblage of huts within\n",
      "a wooden fence; the fortresses are seated in the depths of forests; the\n",
      "princely town of Cyta, or Cotatis, consists of two hundred houses, and a\n",
      "stone edifice appertains only to the magnificence of kings. Twelve ships\n",
      "from Constantinople, and about sixty barks, laden with the fruits of\n",
      "industry, annually cast anchor on the coast; and the list of Colchian\n",
      "exports is much increased, since the natives had only slaves and hides\n",
      "to offer in exchange for the corn and salt which they purchased from\n",
      "the subjects of Justinian. Not a vestige can be found of the art, the\n",
      "knowledge, or the navigation, of the ancient Colchians: few Greeks\n",
      "desired or dared to pursue the footsteps of the Argonauts; and even the\n",
      "marks of an Egyptian colony are lost on a nearer approach. The rite of\n",
      "circumcision is practised only by the Mahometans of the Euxine; and the\n",
      "curled hair and swarthy complexion of Africa no longer disfigure the\n",
      "most perfect of the human race. It is in the adjacent climates of\n",
      "Georgia, Mingrelia, and Circassia, that nature has placed, at least to\n",
      "our eyes, the model of beauty in the shape of the limbs, the color\n",
      "of the skin, the symmetry of the features, and the expression of the\n",
      "countenance. According to the destination of the two sexes, the men\n",
      "seemed formed for action, the women for love; and the perpetual supply\n",
      "of females from Mount Caucasus has purified the blood, and improved\n",
      "the breed, of the southern nations of Asia. The proper district of\n",
      "Mingrelia, a portion only of the ancient Colchos, has long sustained\n",
      "an exportation of twelve thousand slaves. The number of prisoners or\n",
      "criminals would be inadequate to the annual demand; but the common\n",
      "people are in a state of servitude to their lords; the exercise of\n",
      "fraud or rapine is unpunished in a lawless community; and the market is\n",
      "continually replenished by the abuse of civil and paternal authority.\n",
      "Such a trade, which reduces the human species to the level of cattle,\n",
      "may tend to encourage marriage and population, since the multitude of\n",
      "children enriches their sordid and inhuman parent. But this source of\n",
      "impure wealth must inevitably poison the national manners, obliterate\n",
      "the sense of honor and virtue, and almost extinguish the instincts of\n",
      "nature: the _Christians_ of Georgia and Mingrelia are the most dissolute\n",
      "of mankind; and their children, who, in a tender age, are sold into\n",
      "foreign slavery, have already learned to imitate the rapine of the\n",
      "father and the prostitution of the mother. Yet, amidst the rudest\n",
      "ignorance, the untaught natives discover a singular dexterity both of\n",
      "mind and hand; and although the want of union and discipline exposes\n",
      "them to their more powerful neighbors, a bold and intrepid spirit has\n",
      "animated the Colchians of every age. In the host of Xerxes, they served\n",
      "on foot; and their arms were a dagger or a javelin, a wooden casque, and\n",
      "a buckler of raw hides. But in their own country the use of cavalry has\n",
      "more generally prevailed: the meanest of the peasants disdained to walk;\n",
      "the martial nobles are possessed, perhaps, of two hundred horses;\n",
      "and above five thousand are numbered in the train of the prince of\n",
      "Mingrelia. The Colchian government has been always a pure and hereditary\n",
      "kingdom; and the authority of the sovereign is only restrained by the\n",
      "turbulence of his subjects. Whenever they were obedient, he could lead\n",
      "a numerous army into the field; but some faith is requisite to believe,\n",
      "that the single tribe of the Suanians as composed of two hundred\n",

      "It was the boast of the Colchians, that their ancestors had checked\n",
      "the victories of Sesostris; and the defeat of the Egyptian is less\n",
      "incredible than his successful progress as far as the foot of Mount\n",
      "Caucasus. They sunk without any memorable effort, under the arms of\n",
      "Cyrus; followed in distant wars the standard of the great king, and\n",
      "presented him every fifth year with one hundred boys, and as many\n",
      "virgins, the fairest produce of the land. Yet he accepted this _gift_\n",
      "like the gold and ebony of India, the frankincense of the Arabs, or the\n",
      "negroes and ivory of ∆thiopia: the Colchians were not subject to the\n",
      "dominion of a satrap, and they continued to enjoy the name as well\n",
      "as substance of national independence. After the fall of the Persian\n",
      "empire, Mithridates, king of Pontus, added Colchos to the wide circle\n",
      "of his dominions on the Euxine; and when the natives presumed to request\n",
      "that his son might reign over them, he bound the ambitious youth in\n",
      "chains of gold, and delegated a servant in his place. In pursuit of\n",
      "Mithridates, the Romans advanced to the banks of the Phasis, and their\n",
      "galleys ascended the river till they reached the camp of Pompey and\n",
      "his legions. But the senate, and afterwards the emperors, disdained to\n",
      "reduce that distant and useless conquest into the form of a province.\n",
      "The family of a Greek rhetorician was permitted to reign in Colchos and\n",
      "the adjacent kingdoms from the time of Mark Antony to that of Nero;\n",
      "and after the race of Polemo was extinct, the eastern Pontus, which\n",
      "preserved his name, extended no farther than the neighborhood of\n",
      "Trebizond. Beyond these limits the fortifications of Hyssus, of Apsarus,\n",
      "of the Phasis, of Dioscurias or Sebastopolis, and of Pityus, were\n",
      "guarded by sufficient detachments of horse and foot; and six princes\n",
      "of Colchos received their diadems from the lieutenants of CÊsar. One of\n",
      "these lieutenants, the eloquent and philosophic Arrian, surveyed,\n",
      "and has described, the Euxine coast, under the reign of Hadrian. The\n",
      "garrison which he reviewed at the mouth of the Phasis consisted of\n",
      "four hundred chosen legionaries; the brick walls and towers, the double\n",
      "ditch, and the military engines on the rampart, rendered this place\n",
      "inaccessible to the Barbarians: but the new suburbs which had been built\n",
      "by the merchants and veterans, required, in the opinion of Arrian, some\n",
      "external defence. As the strength of the empire was gradually impaired,\n",
      "the Romans stationed on the Phasis were neither withdrawn nor expelled;\n",
      "and the tribe of the Lazi, whose posterity speak a foreign dialect, and\n",
      "inhabit the sea coast of Trebizond, imposed their name and dominion on\n",
      "the ancient kingdom of Colchos. Their independence was soon invaded by\n",
      "a formidable neighbor, who had acquired, by arms and treaties, the\n",
      "sovereignty of Iberia. The dependent king of Lazica received his sceptre\n",
      "at the hands of the Persian monarch, and the successors of Constantine\n",
      "acquiesced in this injurious claim, which was proudly urged as a right\n",
      "of immemorial prescription. In the beginning of the sixth century, their\n",
      "influence was restored by the introduction of Christianity, which the\n",
      "Mingrelians still profess with becoming zeal, without understanding\n",
      "the doctrines, or observing the precepts, of their religion. After the\n",
      "decease of his father, Zathus was exalted to the regal dignity by the\n",
      "favor of the great king; but the pious youth abhorred the ceremonies\n",
      "of the Magi, and sought, in the palace of Constantinople, an orthodox\n",
      "baptism, a noble wife, and the alliance of the emperor Justin. The king\n",
      "of Lazica was solemnly invested with the diadem, and his cloak and tunic\n",
      "of white silk, with a gold border, displayed, in rich embroidery, the\n",
      "figure of his new patron; who soothed the jealousy of the Persian court,\n",
      "and excused the revolt of Colchos, by the venerable names of hospitality\n",
      "and religion. The common interest of both empires imposed on the\n",
      "Colchians the duty of guarding the passes of Mount Caucasus, where\n",
      "a wall of sixty miles is now defended by the monthly service of the\n",
      "musketeers of Mingrelia.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this honorable connection was soon corrupted by the avarice and\n",
      "ambition of the Romans. Degraded from the rank of allies, the Lazi were\n",
      "incessantly reminded, by words and actions, of their dependent state.\n",
      "At the distance of a day's journey beyond the Apsarus, they beheld the\n",
      "rising fortress of Petra, which commanded the maritime country to the\n",
      "south of the Phasis. Instead of being protected by the valor, Colchos\n",
      "was insulted by the licentiousness, of foreign mercenaries; the benefits\n",
      "of commerce were converted into base and vexatious monopoly; and\n",
      "Gubazes, the native prince, was reduced to a pageant of royalty, by the\n",
      "superior influence of the officers of Justinian. Disappointed in their\n",
      "expectations of Christian virtue, the indignant Lazi reposed some\n",
      "confidence in the justice of an unbeliever. After a private assurance\n",
      "that their ambassadors should not be delivered to the Romans, they\n",
      "publicly solicited the friendship and aid of Chosroes. The sagacious\n",
      "monarch instantly discerned the use and importance of Colchos; and\n",
      "meditated a plan of conquest, which was renewed at the end of a thousand\n",
      "years by Shah Abbas, the wisest and most powerful of his successors.\n",
      "His ambition was fired by the hope of launching a Persian navy from the\n",
      "Phasis, of commanding the trade and navigation of the Euxine Sea, of\n",
      "desolating the coast of Pontus and Bithynia, of distressing, perhaps of\n",
      "attacking, Constantinople, and of persuading the Barbarians of Europe to\n",
      "second his arms and counsels against the common enemy of mankind.\n",
      "Under the pretence of a Scythian war, he silently led his troops to the\n",
      "frontiers of Iberia; the Colchian guides were prepared to conduct them\n",
      "through the woods and along the precipices of Mount Caucasus; and a\n",
      "narrow path was laboriously formed into a safe and spacious highway, for\n",
      "the march of cavalry, and even of elephants. Gubazes laid his person\n",
      "and diadem at the feet of the king of Persia; his Colchians imitated\n",
      "the submission of their prince; and after the walls of Petra had been\n",
      "shaken, the Roman garrison prevented, by a capitulation, the impending\n",
      "fury of the last assault. But the Lazi soon discovered, that their\n",
      "impatience had urged them to choose an evil more intolerable than the\n",
      "calamities which they strove to escape. The monopoly of salt and corn\n",
      "was effectually removed by the loss of those valuable commodities.\n",
      "The authority of a Roman legislator, was succeeded by the pride of an\n",
      "Oriental despot, who beheld, with equal disdain, the slaves whom he had\n",
      "exalted, and the kings whom he had humbled before the footstool of his\n",
      "throne. The adoration of fire was introduced into Colchos by the zeal\n",
      "of the Magi: their intolerant spirit provoked the fervor of a Christian\n",
      "people; and the prejudice of nature or education was wounded by the\n",
      "impious practice of exposing the dead bodies of their parents, on the\n",
      "summit of a lofty tower, to the crows and vultures of the air. Conscious\n",
      "of the increasing hatred, which retarded the execution of his great\n",
      "designs, the just Nashirvan had secretly given orders to assassinate the\n",
      "king of the Lazi, to transplant the people into some distant land, and\n",
      "to fix a faithful and warlike colony on the banks of the Phasis. The\n",
      "watchful jealousy of the Colchians foresaw and averted the approaching\n",
      "ruin. Their repentance was accepted at Constantinople by the prudence,\n",
      "rather than clemency, of Justinian; and he commanded Dagisteus, with\n",
      "seven thousand Romans, and one thousand of the Zani, to expel the\n",
      "Persians from the coast of the Euxine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The siege of Petra, which the Roman general, with the aid of the Lazi,\n",
      "immediately undertook, is one of the most remarkable actions of the\n",
      "age. The city was seated on a craggy rock, which hung over the sea,\n",
      "and communicated by a steep and narrow path with the land. Since the\n",
      "approach was difficult, the attack might be deemed impossible: the\n",
      "Persian conqueror had strengthened the fortifications of Justinian; and\n",
      "the places least inaccessible were covered by additional bulwarks.\n",
      "In this important fortress, the vigilance of Chosroes had deposited a\n",
      "magazine of offensive and defensive arms, sufficient for five times the\n",
      "number, not only of the garrison, but of the besiegers themselves. The\n",
      "stock of flour and salt provisions was adequate to the consumption of\n",
      "five years; the want of wine was supplied by vinegar; and of grain from\n",
      "whence a strong liquor was extracted, and a triple aqueduct eluded\n",
      "the diligence, and even the suspicions, of the enemy. But the firmest\n",
      "defence of Petra was placed in the valor of fifteen hundred Persians,\n",
      "who resisted the assaults of the Romans, whilst, in a softer vein of\n",
      "earth, a mine was secretly perforated. The wall, supported by slender\n",
      "and temporary props, hung tottering in the air; but Dagisteus delayed\n",
      "the attack till he had secured a specific recompense; and the town was\n",
      "relieved before the return of his messenger from Constantinople. The\n",
      "Persian garrison was reduced to four hundred men, of whom no more than\n",
      "fifty were exempt from sickness or wounds; yet such had been their\n",
      "inflexible perseverance, that they concealed their losses from the\n",
      "enemy, by enduring, without a murmur, the sight and putrefying stench\n",
      "of the dead bodies of their eleven hundred companions. After their\n",
      "deliverance, the breaches were hastily stopped with sand-bags; the\n",
      "mine was replenished with earth; a new wall was erected on a frame\n",
      "of substantial timber; and a fresh garrison of three thousand men\n",
      "was stationed at Petra to sustain the labors of a second siege. The\n",
      "operations, both of the attack and defence, were conducted with skilful\n",
      "obstinacy; and each party derived useful lessons from the experience of\n",
      "their past faults. A battering-ram was invented, of light construction\n",
      "and powerful effect: it was transported and worked by the hands of forty\n",
      "soldiers; and as the stones were loosened by its repeated strokes, they\n",
      "were torn with long iron hooks from the wall. From those walls, a shower\n",
      "of darts was incessantly poured on the heads of the assailants; but\n",
      "they were most dangerously annoyed by a fiery composition of sulphur and\n",
      "bitumen, which in Colchos might with some propriety be named the oil\n",
      "of Medea. Of six thousand Romans who mounted the scaling-ladders, their\n",
      "general Bessas was the first, a gallant veteran of seventy years of age:\n",
      "the courage of their leader, his fall, and extreme danger, animated\n",
      "the irresistible effort of his troops; and their prevailing numbers\n",
      "oppressed the strength, without subduing the spirit, of the Persian\n",
      "garrison. The fate of these valiant men deserves to be more distinctly\n",
      "noticed. Seven hundred had perished in the siege, two thousand three\n",
      "hundred survived to defend the breach. One thousand and seventy were\n",
      "destroyed with fire and sword in the last assault; and if seven hundred\n",
      "and thirty were made prisoners, only eighteen among them were found\n",
      "without the marks of honorable wounds. The remaining five hundred\n",
      "escaped into the citadel, which they maintained without any hopes of\n",
      "relief, rejecting the fairest terms of capitulation and service, till\n",
      "they were lost in the flames. They died in obedience to the commands of\n",
      "their prince; and such examples of loyalty and valor might excite their\n",
      "countrymen to deeds of equal despair and more prosperous event. The\n",
      "instant demolition of the works of Petra confessed the astonishment and\n",
      "apprehension of the conqueror.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Spartan would have praised and pitied the virtue of these heroic\n",
      "slaves; but the tedious warfare and alternate success of the Roman and\n",
      "Persian arms cannot detain the attention of posterity at the foot of\n",
      "Mount Caucasus. The advantages obtained by the troops of Justinian\n",
      "were more frequent and splendid; but the forces of the great king were\n",
      "continually supplied, till they amounted to eight elephants and seventy\n",
      "thousand men, including twelve thousand Scythian allies, and above three\n",
      "thousand Dilemites, who descended by their free choice from the hills of\n",
      "Hyrcania, and were equally formidable in close or in distant combat.\n",
      "The siege of ArchÊopolis, a name imposed or corrupted by the Greeks, was\n",
      "raised with some loss and precipitation; but the Persians occupied the\n",
      "passes of Iberia: Colchos was enslaved by their forts and garrisons;\n",
      "they devoured the scanty sustenance of the people; and the prince of the\n",
      "Lazi fled into the mountains. In the Roman camp, faith and discipline\n",
      "were unknown; and the independent leaders, who were invested with equal\n",
      "power, disputed with each other the preeminence of vice and corruption.\n",
      "The Persians followed, without a murmur, the commands of a single chief,\n",
      "who implicitly obeyed the instructions of their supreme lord. Their\n",
      "general was distinguished among the heroes of the East by his wisdom in\n",
      "council, and his valor in the field. The advanced age of Mermeroes, and\n",
      "the lameness of both his feet, could not diminish the activity of his\n",
      "mind, or even of his body; and, whilst he was carried in a litter in the\n",
      "front of battle, he inspired terror to the enemy, and a just confidence\n",
      "to the troops, who, under his banners, were always successful. After\n",
      "his death, the command devolved to Nacoragan, a proud satrap, who, in\n",
      "a conference with the Imperial chiefs, had presumed to declare that he\n",
      "disposed of victory as absolutely as of the ring on his finger. Such\n",
      "presumption was the natural cause and forerunner of a shameful defeat.\n",
      "The Romans had been gradually repulsed to the edge of the sea-shore;\n",
      "and their last camp, on the ruins of the Grecian colony of Phasis, was\n",
      "defended on all sides by strong intrenchments, the river, the Euxine,\n",
      "and a fleet of galleys. Despair united their counsels and invigorated\n",
      "their arms: they withstood the assault of the Persians and the flight\n",
      "of Nacoragan preceded or followed the slaughter of ten thousand of his\n",
      "bravest soldiers. He escaped from the Romans to fall into the hands\n",
      "of an unforgiving master who severely chastised the error of his own\n",
      "choice: the unfortunate general was flayed alive, and his skin, stuffed\n",
      "into the human form, was exposed on a mountain; a dreadful warning to\n",
      "those who might hereafter be intrusted with the fame and fortune\n",
      "of Persia. Yet the prudence of Chosroes insensibly relinquished the\n",
      "prosecution of the Colchian war, in the just persuasion, that it is\n",
      "impossible to reduce, or, at least, to hold a distant country against\n",
      "the wishes and efforts of its inhabitants. The fidelity of Gubazes\n",
      "sustained the most rigorous trials. He patiently endured the hardships\n",
      "of a savage life, and rejected with disdain, the specious temptations\n",
      "of the Persian court. The king of the Lazi had been educated in the\n",
      "Christian religion; his mother was the daughter of a senator; during his\n",
      "youth he had served ten years a silentiary of the Byzantine palace, and\n",
      "the arrears of an unpaid salary were a motive of attachment as well as\n",
      "of complaint. But the long continuance of his sufferings extorted from\n",
      "him a naked representation of the truth; and truth was an unpardonable\n",
      "libel on the lieutenants of Justinian, who, amidst the delays of a\n",
      "ruinous war, had spared his enemies and trampled on his allies. Their\n",
      "malicious information persuaded the emperor that his faithless vassal\n",
      "already meditated a second defection: an order was surprised to send him\n",
      "prisoner to Constantinople; a treacherous clause was inserted, that he\n",
      "might be lawfully killed in case of resistance; and Gubazes, without\n",
      "arms, or suspicion of danger, was stabbed in the security of a friendly\n",
      "interview. In the first moments of rage and despair, the Colchians\n",
      "would have sacrificed their country and religion to the gratification\n",
      "of revenge. But the authority and eloquence of the wiser few obtained\n",
      "a salutary pause: the victory of the Phasis restored the terror of the\n",
      "Roman arms, and the emperor was solicitous to absolve his own name\n",
      "from the imputation of so foul a murder. A judge of senatorial rank was\n",
      "commissioned to inquire into the conduct and death of the king of the\n",
      "Lazi. He ascended a stately tribunal, encompassed by the ministers\n",
      "of justice and punishment: in the presence of both nations, this\n",
      "extraordinary cause was pleaded, according to the forms of civil\n",
      "jurisprudence, and some satisfaction was granted to an injured people,\n",
      "by the sentence and execution of the meaner criminals.\n",
      "\n",
      "In peace, the king of Persia continually sought the pretences of a\n",
      "rupture: but no sooner had he taken up arms, than he expressed his\n",
      "desire of a safe and honorable treaty. During the fiercest hostilities,\n",
      "the two monarchs entertained a deceitful negotiation; and such was the\n",
      "superiority of Chosroes, that whilst he treated the Roman ministers with\n",
      "insolence and contempt, he obtained the most unprecedented honors\n",
      "for his own ambassadors at the Imperial court. The successor of Cyrus\n",
      "assumed the majesty of the Eastern sun, and graciously permitted his\n",
      "younger brother Justinian to reign over the West, with the pale and\n",
      "reflected splendor of the moon. This gigantic style was supported by the\n",
      "pomp and eloquence of Isdigune, one of the royal chamberlains. His wife\n",
      "and daughters, with a train of eunuchs and camels, attended the march of\n",
      "the ambassador: two satraps with golden diadems were numbered among his\n",
      "followers: he was guarded by five hundred horse, the most valiant of the\n",
      "Persians; and the Roman governor of Dara wisely refused to admit more\n",
      "than twenty of this martial and hostile caravan. When Isdigune had\n",
      "saluted the emperor, and delivered his presents, he passed ten months at\n",
      "Constantinople without discussing any serious affairs. Instead of being\n",
      "confined to his palace, and receiving food and water from the hands\n",
      "of his keepers, the Persian ambassador, without spies or guards, was\n",
      "allowed to visit the capital; and the freedom of conversation and\n",
      "trade enjoyed by his domestics, offended the prejudices of an age which\n",
      "rigorously practised the law of nations, without confidence or courtesy.\n",
      "By an unexampled indulgence, his interpreter, a servant below the notice\n",
      "of a Roman magistrate, was seated, at the table of Justinian, by the\n",
      "side of his master: and one thousand pounds of gold might be assigned\n",
      "for the expense of his journey and entertainment. Yet the repeated\n",
      "labors of Isdigune could procure only a partial and imperfect truce,\n",
      "which was always purchased with the treasures, and renewed at the\n",

      "held on the frontier, each party, without expecting to gain credit,\n",
      "displayed the power, the justice, and the pacific intentions, of their\n",
      "respective sovereigns; but necessity and interest dictated the treaty\n",
      "of peace, which was concluded for a term of fifty years, diligently\n",
      "composed in the Greek and Persian languages, and attested by the seals\n",
      "of twelve interpreters. The liberty of commerce and religion was fixed\n",
      "and defined; the allies of the emperor and the great king were\n",
      "included in the same benefits and obligations; and the most scrupulous\n",
      "precautions were provided to prevent or determine the accidental\n",
      "disputes that might arise on the confines of two hostile nations. After\n",
      "twenty years of destructive though feeble war, the limits still remained\n",
      "without alteration; and Chosroes was persuaded to renounce his dangerous\n",
      "claim to the possession or sovereignty of Colchos and its dependent\n",
      "states. Rich in the accumulated treasures of the East, he extorted from\n",
      "the Romans an annual payment of thirty thousand pieces of gold; and the\n",
      "smallness of the sum revealed the disgrace of a tribute in its naked\n",
      "deformity. In a previous debate, the chariot of Sesostris, and the\n",
      "wheel of fortune, were applied by one of the ministers of Justinian,\n",
      "who observed that the reduction of Antioch, and some Syrian cities, had\n",
      "elevated beyond measure the vain and ambitious spirit of the Barbarian.\n",
      "\"You are mistaken,\" replied the modest Persian: \"the king of kings, the\n",
      "lord of mankind, looks down with contempt on such petty acquisitions;\n",
      "and of the ten nations, vanquished by his invincible arms, he esteems\n",
      "the Romans as the least formidable.\" According to the Orientals, the\n",
      "empire of Nushirvan extended from Ferganah, in Transoxiana, to Yemen or\n",
      "Arabia FÊlix. He subdued the rebels of Hyrcania, reduced the provinces\n",
      "of Cabul and Zablestan on the banks of the Indus, broke the power of\n",
      "the Euthalites, terminated by an honorable treaty the Turkish war, and\n",
      "admitted the daughter of the great khan into the number of his lawful\n",
      "wives. Victorious and respected among the princes of Asia, he gave\n",
      "audience, in his palace of Madain, or Ctesiphon, to the ambassadors of\n",
      "the world. Their gifts or tributes, arms, rich garments, gems, slaves\n",
      "or aromatics, were humbly presented at the foot of his throne; and he\n",
      "condescended to accept from the king of India ten quintals of the wood\n",
      "of aloes, a maid seven cubits in height, and a carpet softer than silk,\n",
      "the skin, as it was reported, of an extraordinary serpent.\n",

      "Justinian had been reproached for his alliance with the ∆thiopians, as\n",
      "if he attempted to introduce a people of savage negroes into the system\n",
      "of civilized society. But the friends of the Roman empire, the Axumites,\n",
      "or Abyssinians, may be always distinguished from the original natives\n",
      "of Africa. The hand of nature has flattened the noses of the negroes,\n",
      "covered their heads with shaggy wool, and tinged their skin with\n",
      "inherent and indelible blackness. But the olive complexion of the\n",
      "Abyssinians, their hair, shape, and features, distinctly mark them as\n",
      "a colony of Arabs; and this descent is confirmed by the resemblance of\n",
      "language and manners the report of an ancient emigration, and the narrow\n",
      "interval between the shores of the Red Sea. Christianity had raised\n",
      "that nation above the level of African barbarism: their intercourse with\n",
      "Egypt, and the successors of Constantine, had communicated the rudiments\n",
      "of the arts and sciences; their vessels traded to the Isle of Ceylon,\n",
      "and seven kingdoms obeyed the Negus or supreme prince of Abyssinia. The\n",
      "independence of the Homerites, who reigned in the rich and happy Arabia,\n",
      "was first violated by an ∆thiopian conqueror: he drew his hereditary\n",
      "claim from the queen of Sheba, and his ambition was sanctified by\n",
      "religious zeal. The Jews, powerful and active in exile, had seduced the\n",
      "mind of Dunaan, prince of the Homerites. They urged him to retaliate\n",
      "the persecution inflicted by the Imperial laws on their unfortunate\n",
      "brethren: some Roman merchants were injuriously treated; and several\n",
      "Christians of Negra were honored with the crown of martyrdom. The\n",
      "churches of Arabia implored the protection of the Abyssinian monarch.\n",
      "The Negus passed the Red Sea with a fleet and army, deprived the Jewish\n",
      "proselyte of his kingdom and life, and extinguished a race of princes,\n",
      "who had ruled above two thousand years the sequestered region of myrrh\n",
      "and frankincense. The conqueror immediately announced the victory of\n",
      "the gospel, requested an orthodox patriarch, and so warmly professed his\n",
      "friendship to the Roman empire, that Justinian was flattered by the hope\n",
      "of diverting the silk trade through the channel of Abyssinia, and\n",
      "of exciting the forces of Arabia against the Persian king. Nonnosus,\n",
      "descended from a family of ambassadors, was named by the emperor to\n",
      "execute this important commission. He wisely declined the shorter, but\n",
      "more dangerous, road, through the sandy deserts of Nubia; ascended the\n",
      "Nile, embarked on the Red Sea, and safely landed at the African port\n",
      "of Adulis. From Adulis to the royal city of Axume is no more than fifty\n",
      "leagues, in a direct line; but the winding passes of the mountains\n",
      "detained the ambassador fifteen days; and as he traversed the forests,\n",
      "he saw, and vaguely computed, about five thousand wild elephants.\n",
      "The capital, according to his report, was large and populous; and the\n",
      "_village_ of Axume is still conspicuous by the regal coronations, by\n",
      "the ruins of a Christian temple, and by sixteen or seventeen obelisks\n",
      "inscribed with Grecian characters. But the Negus gave audience in\n",
      "the open field, seated on a lofty chariot, which was drawn by four\n",
      "elephants, superbly caparisoned, and surrounded by his nobles and\n",
      "musicians. He was clad in a linen garment and cap, holding in his\n",
      "hand two javelins and a light shield; and, although his nakedness was\n",
      "imperfectly covered, he displayed the Barbaric pomp of gold chains,\n",
      "collars, and bracelets, richly adorned with pearls and precious stones.\n",
      "The ambassador of Justinian knelt; the Negus raised him from the ground,\n",
      "embraced Nonnosus, kissed the seal, perused the letter, accepted the\n",
      "Roman alliance, and, brandishing his weapons, denounced implacable war\n",
      "against the worshipers of fire. But the proposal of the silk trade was\n",
      "eluded; and notwithstanding the assurances, and perhaps the wishes, of\n",
      "the Abyssinians, these hostile menaces evaporated without effect. The\n",
      "Homerites were unwilling to abandon their aromatic groves, to explore a\n",
      "sandy desert, and to encounter, after all their fatigues, a formidable\n",
      "nation from whom they had never received any personal injuries. Instead\n",
      "of enlarging his conquests, the king of ∆thiopia was incapable of\n",
      "defending his possessions. Abrahah, ß the slave of a Roman merchant of\n",
      "Adulis, assumed the sceptre of the Homerites; the troops of Africa\n",
      "were seduced by the luxury of the climate; and Justinian solicited\n",
      "the friendship of the usurper, who honored with a slight tribute the\n",
      "supremacy of his prince. After a long series of prosperity, the power of\n",
      "Abrahah was overthrown before the gates of Mecca; and his children were\n",
      "despoiled by the Persian conqueror; and the ∆thiopians were finally\n",
      "expelled from the continent of Asia. This narrative of obscure and\n",
      "remote events is not foreign to the decline and fall of the Roman\n",
      "empire. If a Christian power had been maintained in Arabia, Mahomet must\n",

      "every side, the weakness of the Romans; and our wonder is reasonably\n",
      "excited that they should presume to enlarge an empire whose ancient\n",
      "limits they were incapable of defending. But the wars, the conquests,\n",
      "and the triumphs of Justinian, are the feeble and pernicious efforts of\n",
      "old age, which exhaust the remains of strength, and accelerate the\n",

      "\n",
      "From his new acquisitions, Justinian expected that his avarice, as\n",
      "well as pride, should be richly gratified. A rapacious minister of the\n",
      "finances closely pursued the footsteps of Belisarius; and as the old\n",
      "registers of tribute had been burnt by the Vandals, he indulged his\n",
      "fancy in a liberal calculation and arbitrary assessment of the wealth\n",

      "soon dispelled the intoxication of the public joy: but the emperor was\n",
      "insensible to the modest complaints of the people, till he was awakened\n",
      "and alarmed by the clamors of military discontent. Many of the Roman\n",
      "soldiers had married the widows and daughters of the Vandals. As their\n",
      "own, by the double right of conquest and inheritance, they claimed the\n",
      "estates which Genseric had assigned to his victorious troops. They heard\n",
      "with disdain the cold and selfish representations of their officers,\n",
      "that the liberality of Justinian had raised them from a savage or\n",
      "servile condition; that they were already enriched by the spoils of\n",
      "Africa, the treasure, the slaves, and the movables of the vanquished\n",
      "Barbarians; and that the ancient and lawful patrimony of the emperors\n",
      "would be applied only to the support of that government on which their\n",
      "own safety and reward must ultimately depend. The mutiny was secretly\n",
      "inflamed by a thousand soldiers, for the most part Heruli, who had\n",
      "imbibed the doctrines, and were instigated by the clergy, of the Arian\n",
      "sect; and the cause of perjury and rebellion was sanctified by the\n",
      "dispensing powers of fanaticism. The Arians deplored the ruin of their\n",
      "church, triumphant above a century in Africa; and they were justly\n",
      "provoked by the laws of the conqueror, which interdicted the baptism\n",
      "of their children, and the exercise of all religious worship. Of the\n",
      "Vandals chosen by Belisarius, the far greater part, in the honors of the\n",
      "Eastern service, forgot their country and religion. But a generous band\n",
      "of four hundred obliged the mariners, when they were in sight of the\n",
      "Isle of Lesbos, to alter their course: they touched on Peloponnesus,\n",
      "ran ashore on a desert coast of Africa, and boldly erected, on Mount\n",
      "Aurasius, the standard of independence and revolt. While the troops of\n",
      "the provinces disclaimed the commands of their superiors, a conspiracy\n",
      "was formed at Carthage against the life of Solomon, who filled with\n",
      "honor the place of Belisarius; and the Arians had piously resolved\n",
      "to sacrifice the tyrant at the foot of the altar, during the awful\n",
      "mysteries of the festival of Easter. Fear or remorse restrained the\n",
      "daggers of the assassins, but the patience of Solomon emboldened their\n",
      "discontent; and, at the end of ten days, a furious sedition was kindled\n",
      "in the Circus, which desolated Africa above ten years. The pillage of\n",
      "the city, and the indiscriminate slaughter of its inhabitants, were\n",
      "suspended only by darkness, sleep, and intoxication: the governor, with\n",
      "seven companions, among whom was the historian Procopius, escaped to\n",
      "Sicily: two thirds of the army were involved in the guilt of treason;\n",
      "and eight thousand insurgents, assembling in the field of Bulla, elected\n",
      "Stoza for their chief, a private soldier, who possessed in a superior\n",
      "degree the virtues of a rebel. Under the mask of freedom, his eloquence\n",
      "could lead, or at least impel, the passions of his equals. He raised\n",
      "himself to a level with Belisarius, and the nephew of the emperor, by\n",
      "daring to encounter them in the field; and the victorious generals were\n",
      "compelled to acknowledge that Stoza deserved a purer cause, and a more\n",
      "legitimate command. Vanquished in battle, he dexterously employed the\n",
      "arts of negotiation; a Roman army was seduced from their allegiance, and\n",
      "the chiefs who had trusted to his faithless promise were murdered by his\n",
      "order in a church of Numidia. When every resource, either of force or\n",
      "perfidy, was exhausted, Stoza, with some desperate Vandals, retired to\n",
      "the wilds of Mauritania, obtained the daughter of a Barbarian prince,\n",
      "and eluded the pursuit of his enemies, by the report of his death. The\n",
      "personal weight of Belisarius, the rank, the spirit, and the temper, of\n",
      "Germanus, the emperor's nephew, and the vigor and success of the second\n",
      "administration of the eunuch Solomon, restored the modesty of the camp,\n",
      "and maintained for a while the tranquillity of Africa. But the vices\n",
      "of the Byzantine court were felt in that distant province; the troops\n",
      "complained that they were neither paid nor relieved, and as soon as the\n",
      "public disorders were sufficiently mature, Stoza was again alive, in\n",
      "arms, and at the gates of Carthage. He fell in a single combat, but\n",
      "he smiled in the agonies of death, when he was informed that his own\n",
      "javelin had reached the heart of his antagonist. The example of Stoza,\n",
      "and the assurance that a fortunate soldier had been the first king,\n",
      "encouraged the ambition of Gontharis, and he promised, by a private\n",
      "treaty, to divide Africa with the Moors, if, with their dangerous\n",
      "aid, he should ascend the throne of Carthage. The feeble Areobindus,\n",
      "unskilled in the affairs of peace and war, was raised, by his marriage\n",
      "with the niece of Justinian, to the office of exarch. He was suddenly\n",
      "oppressed by a sedition of the guards, and his abject supplications,\n",
      "which provoked the contempt, could not move the pity, of the inexorable\n",
      "tyrant. After a reign of thirty days, Gontharis himself was stabbed at\n",
      "a banquet by the hand of Artaban; and it is singular enough, that an\n",
      "Armenian prince, of the royal family of Arsaces, should reestablish\n",
      "at Carthage the authority of the Roman empire. In the conspiracy\n",
      "which unsheathed the dagger of Brutus against the life of CÊsar, every\n",
      "circumstance is curious and important to the eyes of posterity; but the\n",
      "guilt or merit of these loyal or rebellious assassins could interest\n",
      "only the contemporaries of Procopius, who, by their hopes and fears,\n",
      "their friendship or resentment, were personally engaged in the\n",
      "revolutions of Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "That country was rapidly sinking into the state of barbarism from whence\n",
      "it had been raised by the Phnician colonies and Roman laws; and every\n",
      "step of intestine discord was marked by some deplorable victory of\n",
      "savage man over civilized society. The Moors, though ignorant of\n",
      "justice, were impatient of oppression: their vagrant life and boundless\n",
      "wilderness disappointed the arms, and eluded the chains, of a conqueror;\n",
      "and experience had shown, that neither oaths nor obligations could\n",
      "secure the fidelity of their attachment. The victory of Mount Auras had\n",
      "awed them into momentary submission; but if they respected the character\n",
      "of Solomon, they hated and despised the pride and luxury of his two\n",
      "nephews, Cyrus and Sergius, on whom their uncle had imprudently bestowed\n",
      "the provincial governments of Tripoli and Pentapolis. A Moorish tribe\n",
      "encamped under the walls of Leptis, to renew their alliance, and receive\n",
      "from the governor the customary gifts. Fourscore of their deputies were\n",
      "introduced as friends into the city; but on the dark suspicion of a\n",
      "conspiracy, they were massacred at the table of Sergius, and the clamor\n",
      "of arms and revenge was reÎchoed through the valleys of Mount Atlas from\n",
      "both the Syrtes to the Atlantic Ocean. A personal injury, the unjust\n",
      "execution or murder of his brother, rendered Antalas the enemy of the\n",
      "Romans. The defeat of the Vandals had formerly signalized his valor; the\n",
      "rudiments of justice and prudence were still more conspicuous in a Moor;\n",
      "and while he laid Adrumetum in ashes, he calmly admonished the emperor\n",
      "that the peace of Africa might be secured by the recall of Solomon and\n",
      "his unworthy nephews. The exarch led forth his troops from Carthage:\n",
      "but, at the distance of six days' journey, in the neighborhood of\n",
      "Tebeste, he was astonished by the superior numbers and fierce aspect of\n",
      "the Barbarians. He proposed a treaty; solicited a reconciliation; and\n",
      "offered to bind himself by the most solemn oaths. \"By what oaths can he\n",
      "bind himself?\" interrupted the indignant Moors. \"Will he swear by the\n",
      "Gospels, the divine books of the Christians? It was on those books that\n",
      "the faith of his nephew Sergius was pledged to eighty of our innocent\n",
      "and unfortunate brethren. Before we trust them a second time, let us\n",
      "try their efficacy in the chastisement of perjury and the vindication of\n",
      "their own honor.\" Their honor was vindicated in the field of Tebeste, by\n",
      "the death of Solomon, and the total loss of his army. The arrival of\n",
      "fresh troops and more skilful commanders soon checked the insolence of\n",
      "the Moors: seventeen of their princes were slain in the same battle;\n",
      "and the doubtful and transient submission of their tribes was celebrated\n",
      "with lavish applause by the people of Constantinople. Successive inroads\n",
      "had reduced the province of Africa to one third of the measure of Italy;\n",
      "yet the Roman emperors continued to reign above a century over Carthage\n",
      "and the fruitful coast of the Mediterranean. But the victories and the\n",
      "losses of Justinian were alike pernicious to mankind; and such was the\n",
      "desolation of Africa, that in many parts a stranger might wander whole\n",
      "days without meeting the face either of a friend or an enemy. The nation\n",
      "of the Vandals had disappeared: they once amounted to a hundred and\n",
      "sixty thousand warriors, without including the children, the women, or\n",
      "the slaves. Their numbers were infinitely surpassed by the number of\n",
      "the Moorish families extirpated in a relentless war; and the same\n",
      "destruction was retaliated on the Romans and their allies, who perished\n",
      "by the climate, their mutual quarrels, and the rage of the Barbarians.\n",
      "When Procopius first landed, he admired the populousness of the cities\n",
      "and country, strenuously exercised in the labors of commerce and\n",
      "agriculture. In less than twenty years, that busy scene was converted\n",
      "into a silent solitude; the wealthy citizens escaped to Sicily and\n",
      "Constantinople; and the secret historian has confidently affirmed, that\n",
      "five millions of Africans were consumed by the wars and government of\n",
      "the emperor Justinian.\n",
      "\n",
      "The jealousy of the Byzantine court had not permitted Belisarius to\n",
      "achieve the conquest of Italy; and his abrupt departure revived the\n",
      "courage of the Goths, who respected his genius, his virtue, and even the\n",
      "laudable motive which had urged the servant of Justinian to deceive and\n",
      "reject them. They had lost their king, (an inconsiderable loss,) their\n",
      "capital, their treasures, the provinces from Sicily to the Alps, and\n",
      "the military force of two hundred thousand Barbarians, magnificently\n",
      "equipped with horses and arms. Yet all was not lost, as long as Pavia\n",
      "was defended by one thousand Goths, inspired by a sense of honor, the\n",
      "love of freedom, and the memory of their past greatness. The supreme\n",
      "command was unanimously offered to the brave Uraias; and it was in his\n",
      "eyes alone that the disgrace of his uncle Vitiges could appear as\n",
      "a reason of exclusion. His voice inclined the election in favor of\n",
      "Hildibald, whose personal merit was recommended by the vain hope that\n",
      "his kinsman Theudes, the Spanish monarch, would support the common\n",
      "interest of the Gothic nation. The success of his arms in Liguria and\n",
      "Venetia seemed to justify their choice; but he soon declared to the\n",
      "world that he was incapable of forgiving or commanding his benefactor.\n",
      "The consort of Hildibald was deeply wounded by the beauty, the riches,\n",
      "and the pride, of the wife of Uraias; and the death of that virtuous\n",
      "patriot excited the indignation of a free people. A bold assassin\n",
      "executed their sentence by striking off the head of Hildibald in the\n",
      "midst of a banquet; the Rugians, a foreign tribe, assumed the privilege\n",
      "of election: and Totila, the nephew of the late king, was tempted, by\n",
      "revenge, to deliver himself and the garrison of Trevigo into the\n",
      "hands of the Romans. But the gallant and accomplished youth was easily\n",
      "persuaded to prefer the Gothic throne before the service of Justinian;\n",
      "and as soon as the palace of Pavia had been purified from the Rugian\n",
      "usurper, he reviewed the national force of five thousand soldiers, and\n",
      "generously undertook the restoration of the kingdom of Italy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The successors of Belisarius, eleven generals of equal rank, neglected\n",
      "to crush the feeble and disunited Goths, till they were roused to action\n",
      "by the progress of Totila and the reproaches of Justinian. The gates\n",
      "of Verona were secretly opened to Artabazus, at the head of one hundred\n",
      "Persians in the service of the empire. The Goths fled from the city. At\n",
      "the distance of sixty furlongs the Roman generals halted to regulate\n",
      "the division of the spoil. While they disputed, the enemy discovered the\n",
      "real number of the victors: the Persians were instantly overpowered, and\n",
      "it was by leaping from the wall that Artabazus preserved a life which\n",
      "he lost in a few days by the lance of a Barbarian, who had defied him to\n",
      "single combat. Twenty thousand Romans encountered the forces of Totila,\n",
      "near Faenza, and on the hills of Mugello, of the Florentine territory.\n",
      "The ardor of freedmen, who fought to regain their country, was opposed\n",
      "to the languid temper of mercenary troops, who were even destitute\n",
      "of the merits of strong and well-disciplined servitude. On the first\n",
      "attack, they abandoned their ensigns, threw down their arms, and\n",
      "dispersed on all sides with an active speed, which abated the loss,\n",
      "whilst it aggravated the shame, of their defeat. The king of the Goths,\n",
      "who blushed for the baseness of his enemies, pursued with rapid steps\n",
      "the path of honor and victory. Totila passed the Po, traversed the\n",
      "Apennine, suspended the important conquest of Ravenna, Florence, and\n",
      "Rome, and marched through the heart of Italy, to form the siege or\n",
      "rather the blockade, of Naples. The Roman chiefs, imprisoned in their\n",
      "respective cities, and accusing each other of the common disgrace, did\n",
      "not presume to disturb his enterprise. But the emperor, alarmed by the\n",
      "distress and danger of his Italian conquests, despatched to the relief\n",
      "of Naples a fleet of galleys and a body of Thracian and Armenian\n",
      "soldiers. They landed in Sicily, which yielded its copious stores\n",
      "of provisions; but the delays of the new commander, an unwarlike\n",
      "magistrate, protracted the sufferings of the besieged; and the succors,\n",
      "which he dropped with a timid and tardy hand, were successively\n",
      "intercepted by the armed vessels stationed by Totila in the Bay of\n",
      "Naples. The principal officer of the Romans was dragged, with a rope\n",
      "round his neck, to the foot of the wall, from whence, with a trembling\n",
      "voice, he exhorted the citizens to implore, like himself, the mercy of\n",
      "the conqueror. They requested a truce, with a promise of surrendering\n",
      "the city, if no effectual relief should appear at the end of thirty\n",
      "days. Instead of _one_ month, the audacious Barbarian granted them\n",
      "_three_, in the just confidence that famine would anticipate the term\n",
      "of their capitulation. After the reduction of Naples and CumÊ, the\n",
      "provinces of Lucania, Apulia, and Calabria, submitted to the king of\n",
      "the Goths. Totila led his army to the gates of Rome, pitched his camp\n",
      "at Tibur, or Tivoli, within twenty miles of the capital, and calmly\n",
      "exhorted the senate and people to compare the tyranny of the Greeks with\n",
      "the blessings of the Gothic reign.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rapid success of Totila may be partly ascribed to the revolution\n",
      "which three years' experience had produced in the sentiments of the\n",
      "Italians. At the command, or at least in the name, of a Catholic\n",
      "emperor, the pope, their spiritual father, had been torn from the Roman\n",
      "church, and either starved or murdered on a desolate island. The virtues\n",
      "of Belisarius were replaced by the various or uniform vices of eleven\n",
      "chiefs, at Rome, Ravenna, Florence, Perugia, Spoleto, &c., who abused\n",
      "their authority for the indulgence of lust or avarice. The improvement\n",
      "of the revenue was committed to Alexander, a subtle scribe, long\n",
      "practised in the fraud and oppression of the Byzantine schools,\n",
      "and whose name of _Psalliction_, the _scissors_, was drawn from the\n",
      "dexterous artifice with which he reduced the size without defacing the\n",
      "figure, of the gold coin. Instead of expecting the restoration of peace\n",
      "and industry, he imposed a heavy assessment on the fortunes of the\n",
      "Italians. Yet his present or future demands were less odious than a\n",
      "prosecution of arbitrary rigor against the persons and property of all\n",
      "those who, under the Gothic kings, had been concerned in the receipt and\n",
      "expenditure of the public money. The subjects of Justinian, who escaped\n",
      "these partial vexations, were oppressed by the irregular maintenance\n",
      "of the soldiers, whom Alexander defrauded and despised; and their hasty\n",
      "sallies in quest of wealth, or subsistence, provoked the inhabitants of\n",
      "the country to await or implore their deliverance from the virtues of\n",
      "a Barbarian. Totila was chaste and temperate; and none were deceived,\n",
      "either friends or enemies, who depended on his faith or his clemency. To\n",
      "the husbandmen of Italy the Gothic king issued a welcome proclamation,\n",
      "enjoining them to pursue their important labors, and to rest assured,\n",
      "that, on the payment of the ordinary taxes, they should be defended by\n",
      "his valor and discipline from the injuries of war. The strong towns he\n",
      "successively attacked; and as soon as they had yielded to his arms, he\n",
      "demolished the fortifications, to save the people from the calamities\n",
      "of a future siege, to deprive the Romans of the arts of defence, and to\n",
      "decide the tedious quarrel of the two nations, by an equal and honorable\n",
      "conflict in the field of battle. The Roman captives and deserters were\n",
      "tempted to enlist in the service of a liberal and courteous adversary;\n",
      "the slaves were attracted by the firm and faithful promise, that they\n",
      "should never be delivered to their masters; and from the thousand\n",
      "warriors of Pavia, a new people, under the same appellation of Goths,\n",
      "was insensibly formed in the camp of Totila. He sincerely accomplished\n",
      "the articles of capitulation, without seeking or accepting any sinister\n",
      "advantage from ambiguous expressions or unforeseen events: the garrison\n",
      "of Naples had stipulated that they should be transported by sea; the\n",
      "obstinacy of the winds prevented their voyage, but they were generously\n",
      "supplied with horses, provisions, and a safe-conduct to the gates of\n",
      "Rome. The wives of the senators, who had been surprised in the villas\n",
      "of Campania, were restored, without a ransom, to their husbands; the\n",
      "violation of female chastity was inexorably chastised with death; and\n",
      "in the salutary regulation of the edict of the famished Neapolitans, the\n",
      "conqueror assumed the office of a humane and attentive physician. The\n",
      "virtues of Totila are equally laudable, whether they proceeded from\n",
      "true policy, religious principle, or the instinct of humanity: he often\n",
      "harangued his troops; and it was his constant theme, that national vice\n",
      "and ruin are inseparably connected; that victory is the fruit of moral\n",
      "as well as military virtue; and that the prince, and even the people,\n",
      "are responsible for the crimes which they neglect to punish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The return of Belisarius to save the country which he had subdued, was\n",
      "pressed with equal vehemence by his friends and enemies; and the Gothic\n",
      "war was imposed as a trust or an exile on the veteran commander. A hero\n",
      "on the banks of the Euphrates, a slave in the palace of Constantinople,\n",
      "he accepted with reluctance the painful task of supporting his own\n",
      "reputation, and retrieving the faults of his successors. The sea was\n",
      "open to the Romans: the ships and soldiers were assembled at Salona,\n",
      "near the palace of Diocletian: he refreshed and reviewed his troops at\n",
      "Pola in Istria, coasted round the head of the Adriatic, entered the\n",
      "port of Ravenna, and despatched orders rather than supplies to the\n",
      "subordinate cities. His first public oration was addressed to the Goths\n",
      "and Romans, in the name of the emperor, who had suspended for a while\n",
      "the conquest of Persia, and listened to the prayers of his Italian\n",
      "subjects. He gently touched on the causes and the authors of the recent\n",
      "disasters; striving to remove the fear of punishment for the past, and\n",
      "the hope of impunity for the future, and laboring, with more zeal than\n",
      "success, to unite all the members of his government in a firm league of\n",
      "affection and obedience. Justinian, his gracious master, was inclined\n",
      "to pardon and reward; and it was their interest, as well as duty, to\n",
      "reclaim their deluded brethren, who had been seduced by the arts of\n",
      "the usurper. Not a man was tempted to desert the standard of the Gothic\n",
      "king. Belisarius soon discovered, that he was sent to remain the idle\n",
      "and impotent spectator of the glory of a young Barbarian; and his own\n",
      "epistle exhibits a genuine and lively picture of the distress of a noble\n",
      "mind. \"Most excellent prince, we are arrived in Italy, destitute of all\n",
      "the necessary implements of war, men, horses, arms, and money. In our\n",
      "late circuit through the villages of Thrace and Illyricum, we have\n",
      "collected, with extreme difficulty, about four thousand recruits, naked,\n",
      "and unskilled in the use of weapons and the exercises of the camp. The\n",
      "soldiers already stationed in the province are discontented, fearful,\n",
      "and dismayed; at the sound of an enemy, they dismiss their horses, and\n",
      "cast their arms on the ground. No taxes can be raised, since Italy is in\n",
      "the hands of the Barbarians; the failure of payment has deprived us of\n",
      "the right of command, or even of admonition. Be assured, dread Sir, that\n",
      "the greater part of your troops have already deserted to the Goths.\n",
      "If the war could be achieved by the presence of Belisarius alone, your\n",
      "wishes are satisfied; Belisarius is in the midst of Italy. But if you\n",
      "desire to conquer, far other preparations are requisite: without a\n",
      "military force, the title of general is an empty name. It would be\n",
      "expedient to restore to my service my own veteran and domestic guards.\n",
      "Before I can take the field, I must receive an adequate supply of light\n",
      "and heavy armed troops; and it is only with ready money that you can\n",
      "procure the indispensable aid of a powerful body of the cavalry of the\n",
      "Huns.\" An officer in whom Belisarius confided was sent from Ravenna to\n",
      "hasten and conduct the succors; but the message was neglected, and the\n",
      "messenger was detained at Constantinople by an advantageous marriage.\n",
      "After his patience had been exhausted by delay and disappointment, the\n",
      "Roman general repassed the Adriatic, and expected at Dyrrachium the\n",
      "arrival of the troops, which were slowly assembled among the subjects\n",
      "and allies of the empire. His powers were still inadequate to the\n",
      "deliverance of Rome, which was closely besieged by the Gothic king. The\n",
      "Appian way, a march of forty days, was covered by the Barbarians; and as\n",
      "the prudence of Belisarius declined a battle, he preferred the safe and\n",
      "speedy navigation of five days from the coast of Epirus to the mouth of\n",
      "the Tyber.\n",
      "\n",
      "After reducing, by force, or treaty, the towns of inferior note in the\n",
      "midland provinces of Italy, Totila proceeded, not to assault, but to\n",
      "encompass and starve, the ancient capital. Rome was afflicted by the\n",
      "avarice, and guarded by the valor, of Bessas, a veteran chief of Gothic\n",
      "extraction, who filled, with a garrison of three thousand soldiers, the\n",
      "spacious circle of her venerable walls. From the distress of the\n",
      "people he extracted a profitable trade, and secretly rejoiced in the\n",
      "continuance of the siege. It was for his use that the granaries had been\n",
      "replenished: the charity of Pope Vigilius had purchased and embarked\n",
      "an ample supply of Sicilian corn; but the vessels which escaped the\n",
      "Barbarians were seized by a rapacious governor, who imparted a scanty\n",
      "sustenance to the soldiers, and sold the remainder to the wealthy\n",
      "Romans. The medimnus, or fifth part of the quarter of wheat, was\n",
      "exchanged for seven pieces of gold; fifty pieces were given for an ox,\n",
      "a rare and accidental prize; the progress of famine enhanced this\n",
      "exorbitant value, and the mercenaries were tempted to deprive themselves\n",
      "of the allowance which was scarcely sufficient for the support of life.\n",
      "A tasteless and unwholesome mixture, in which the bran thrice exceeded\n",
      "the quantity of flour, appeased the hunger of the poor; they were\n",
      "gradually reduced to feed on dead horses, dogs, cats, and mice, and\n",
      "eagerly to snatch the grass, and even the nettles, which grew among the\n",
      "ruins of the city. A crowd of spectres, pale and emaciated, their bodies\n",
      "oppressed with disease, and their minds with despair, surrounded the\n",
      "palace of the governor, urged, with unavailing truth, that it was the\n",
      "duty of a master to maintain his slaves, and humbly requested that he\n",
      "would provide for their subsistence, to permit their flight, or command\n",
      "their immediate execution. Bessas replied, with unfeeling tranquillity,\n",
      "that it was impossible to feed, unsafe to dismiss, and unlawful to kill,\n",
      "the subjects of the emperor. Yet the example of a private citizen might\n",
      "have shown his countrymen that a tyrant cannot withhold the privilege of\n",
      "death. Pierced by the cries of five children, who vainly called on their\n",
      "father for bread, he ordered them to follow his steps, advanced with\n",
      "calm and silent despair to one of the bridges of the Tyber, and,\n",
      "covering his face, threw himself headlong into the stream, in\n",
      "the presence of his family and the Roman people. To the rich and\n",
      "pusillanimous, Bessas sold the permission of departure; but the\n",
      "greatest part of the fugitives expired on the public highways, or were\n",
      "intercepted by the flying parties of Barbarians. In the mean while, the\n",
      "artful governor soothed the discontent, and revived the hopes of\n",
      "the Romans, by the vague reports of the fleets and armies which were\n",
      "hastening to their relief from the extremities of the East. They derived\n",
      "more rational comfort from the assurance that Belisarius had landed at\n",
      "the _port_; and, without numbering his forces, they firmly relied on the\n",
      "humanity, the courage, and the skill of their great deliverer.\n",

      "\n",
      "The foresight of Totila had raised obstacles worthy of such an\n",
      "antagonist. Ninety furlongs below the city, in the narrowest part of the\n",
      "river, he joined the two banks by strong and solid timbers in the form\n",
      "of a bridge, on which he erected two lofty towers, manned by the bravest\n",
      "of his Goths, and profusely stored with missile weapons and engines of\n",
      "offence. The approach of the bridge and towers was covered by a strong\n",
      "and massy chain of iron; and the chain, at either end, on the opposite\n",
      "sides of the Tyber, was defended by a numerous and chosen detachment of\n",
      "archers. But the enterprise of forcing these barriers, and relieving\n",
      "the capital, displays a shining example of the boldness and conduct of\n",
      "Belisarius. His cavalry advanced from the port along the public road, to\n",
      "awe the motions, and distract the attention of the enemy. His infantry\n",
      "and provisions were distributed in two hundred large boats; and each\n",
      "boat was shielded by a high rampart of thick planks, pierced with many\n",
      "small holes for the discharge of missile weapons. In the front, two\n",
      "large vessels were linked together to sustain a floating castle, which\n",
      "commanded the towers of the bridge, and contained a magazine of fire,\n",
      "sulphur, and bitumen. The whole fleet, which the general led in person,\n",
      "was laboriously moved against the current of the river. The chain\n",
      "yielded to their weight, and the enemies who guarded the banks were\n",
      "either slain or scattered. As soon as they touched the principal\n",
      "barrier, the fire-ship was instantly grappled to the bridge; one of\n",
      "the towers, with two hundred Goths, was consumed by the flames; the\n",
      "assailants shouted victory; and Rome was saved, if the wisdom of\n",
      "Belisarius had not been defeated by the misconduct of his officers.\n",
      "He had previously sent orders to Bessas to second his operations by a\n",
      "timely sally from the town; and he had fixed his lieutenant, Isaac, by\n",
      "a peremptory command, to the station of the port. But avarice rendered\n",
      "Bessas immovable; while the youthful ardor of Isaac delivered him into\n",
      "the hands of a superior enemy. The exaggerated rumor of his defeat was\n",
      "hastily carried to the ears of Belisarius: he paused; betrayed in that\n",
      "single moment of his life some emotions of surprise and perplexity; and\n",
      "reluctantly sounded a retreat to save his wife Antonina, his treasures,\n",
      "and the only harbor which he possessed on the Tuscan coast. The vexation\n",
      "of his mind produced an ardent and almost mortal fever; and Rome was\n",
      "left without protection to the mercy or indignation of Totila. The\n",
      "continuance of hostilities had imbittered the national hatred: the Arian\n",
      "clergy was ignominiously driven from Rome; Pelagius, the archdeacon,\n",
      "returned without success from an embassy to the Gothic camp; and a\n",
      "Sicilian bishop, the envoy or nuncio of the pope, was deprived of both\n",
      "his hands, for daring to utter falsehoods in the service of the church\n",
      "and state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Famine had relaxed the strength and discipline of the garrison of Rome.\n",
      "They could derive no effectual service from a dying people; and the\n",
      "inhuman avarice of the merchant at length absorbed the vigilance of the\n",
      "governor. Four Isaurian sentinels, while their companions slept, and\n",
      "their officers were absent, descended by a rope from the wall, and\n",
      "secretly proposed to the Gothic king to introduce his troops into\n",
      "the city. The offer was entertained with coldness and suspicion; they\n",
      "returned in safety; they twice repeated their visit; the place was twice\n",
      "examined; the conspiracy was known and disregarded; and no sooner had\n",
      "Totila consented to the attempt, than they unbarred the Asinarian gate,\n",
      "and gave admittance to the Goths. Till the dawn of day, they halted in\n",
      "order of battle, apprehensive of treachery or ambush; but the troops of\n",
      "Bessas, with their leader, had already escaped; and when the king was\n",
      "pressed to disturb their retreat, he prudently replied, that no sight\n",
      "could be more grateful than that of a flying enemy. The patricians, who\n",
      "were still possessed of horses, Decius, Basilius, &c. accompanied the\n",
      "governor; their brethren, among whom Olybrius, Orestes, and Maximus, are\n",
      "named by the historian, took refuge in the church of St. Peter: but\n",
      "the assertion, that only five hundred persons remained in the capital,\n",
      "inspires some doubt of the fidelity either of his narrative or of his\n",
      "text. As soon as daylight had displayed the entire victory of the Goths,\n",
      "their monarch devoutly visited the tomb of the prince of the apostles;\n",
      "but while he prayed at the altar, twenty-five soldiers, and sixty\n",
      "citizens, were put to the sword in the vestibule of the temple. The\n",
      "archdeacon Pelagius stood before him, with the Gospels in his hand. \"O\n",
      "Lord, be merciful to your servant.\" \"Pelagius,\" said Totila, with an\n",
      "insulting smile, \"your pride now condescends to become a suppliant.\" \"I\n",
      "_am_ a suppliant,\" replied the prudent archdeacon; \"God has now made us\n",
      "your subjects, and as your subjects, we are entitled to your clemency.\"\n",
      "At his humble prayer, the lives of the Romans were spared; and the\n",
      "chastity of the maids and matrons was preserved inviolate from the\n",
      "passions of the hungry soldiers. But they were rewarded by the freedom\n",
      "of pillage, after the most precious spoils had been reserved for the\n",
      "royal treasury. The houses of the senators were plentifully stored with\n",
      "gold and silver; and the avarice of Bessas had labored with so much\n",
      "guilt and shame for the benefit of the conqueror. In this revolution,\n",
      "the sons and daughters of Roman consuls lasted the misery which they had\n",
      "spurned or relieved, wandered in tattered garments through the streets\n",
      "of the city and begged their bread, perhaps without success, before\n",
      "the gates of their hereditary mansions. The riches of Rusticiana, the\n",
      "daughter of Symmachus and widow of Boethius, had been generously\n",
      "devoted to alleviate the calamities of famine. But the Barbarians were\n",
      "exasperated by the report, that she had prompted the people to overthrow\n",
      "the statues of the great Theodoric; and the life of that venerable\n",
      "matron would have been sacrificed to his memory, if Totila had not\n",
      "respected her birth, her virtues, and even the pious motive of her\n",
      "revenge. The next day he pronounced two orations, to congratulate and\n",
      "admonish his victorious Goths, and to reproach the senate, as the\n",
      "vilest of slaves, with their perjury, folly, and ingratitude; sternly\n",
      "declaring, that their estates and honors were justly forfeited to the\n",
      "companions of his arms. Yet he consented to forgive their revolt; and\n",
      "the senators repaid his clemency by despatching circular letters to\n",
      "their tenants and vassals in the provinces of Italy, strictly to enjoin\n",
      "them to desert the standard of the Greeks, to cultivate their lands in\n",
      "peace, and to learn from their masters the duty of obedience to a Gothic\n",
      "sovereign. Against the city which had so long delayed the course of his\n",
      "victories, he appeared inexorable: one third of the walls, in different\n",
      "parts, were demolished by his command; fire and engines prepared to\n",
      "consume or subvert the most stately works of antiquity; and the world\n",
      "was astonished by the fatal decree, that Rome should be changed into a\n",
      "pasture for cattle. The firm and temperate remonstrance of Belisarius\n",
      "suspended the execution; he warned the Barbarian not to sully his fame\n",
      "by the destruction of those monuments which were the glory of the dead,\n",
      "and the delight of the living; and Totila was persuaded, by the advice\n",
      "of an enemy, to preserve Rome as the ornament of his kingdom, or the\n",
      "fairest pledge of peace and reconciliation. When he had signified to\n",
      "the ambassadors of Belisarius his intention of sparing the city, he\n",
      "stationed an army at the distance of one hundred and twenty furlongs,\n",
      "to observe the motions of the Roman general. With the remainder of his\n",
      "forces he marched into Lucania and Apulia, and occupied on the summit of\n",
      "Mount Garganus one of the camps of Hannibal. The senators were dragged\n",
      "in his train, and afterwards confined in the fortresses of Campania: the\n",
      "citizens, with their wives and children, were dispersed in exile; and\n",
      "during forty days Rome was abandoned to desolate and dreary solitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "The loss of Rome was speedily retrieved by an action, to which,\n",
      "according to the event, the public opinion would apply the names of\n",
      "rashness or heroism. After the departure of Totila, the Roman general\n",
      "sallied from the port at the head of a thousand horse, cut in pieces the\n",
      "enemy who opposed his progress, and visited with pity and reverence the\n",
      "vacant space of the _eternal_ city. Resolved to maintain a station so\n",
      "conspicuous in the eyes of mankind, he summoned the greatest part of\n",
      "his troops to the standard which he erected on the Capitol: the old\n",
      "inhabitants were recalled by the love of their country and the hopes\n",
      "of food; and the keys of Rome were sent a second time to the emperor\n",
      "Justinian. The walls, as far as they had been demolished by the\n",
      "Goths, were repaired with rude and dissimilar materials; the ditch was\n",
      "restored; iron spikes were profusely scattered in the highways to annoy\n",
      "the feet of the horses; and as new gates could not suddenly be procured,\n",
      "the entrance was guarded by a Spartan rampart of his bravest soldiers.\n",
      "At the expiration of twenty-five days, Totila returned by hasty marches\n",
      "from Apulia to avenge the injury and disgrace. Belisarius expected his\n",
      "approach. The Goths were thrice repulsed in three general assaults; they\n",
      "lost the flower of their troops; the royal standard had almost fallen\n",
      "into the hands of the enemy, and the fame of Totila sunk, as it had\n",
      "risen, with the fortune of his arms. Whatever skill and courage could\n",
      "achieve, had been performed by the Roman general: it remained only that\n",
      "Justinian should terminate, by a strong and seasonable effort, the\n",
      "war which he had ambitiously undertaken. The indolence, perhaps\n",
      "the impotence, of a prince who despised his enemies, and envied his\n",
      "servants, protracted the calamities of Italy. After a long silence,\n",
      "Belisarius was commanded to leave a sufficient garrison at Rome, and\n",
      "to transport himself into the province of Lucania, whose inhabitants,\n",
      "inflamed by Catholic zeal, had cast away the yoke of their Arian\n",
      "conquerors. In this ignoble warfare, the hero, invincible against\n",
      "the power of the Barbarians, was basely vanquished by the delay, the\n",
      "disobedience, and the cowardice of his own officers. He reposed in his\n",
      "winter quarters of Crotona, in the full assurance, that the two passes\n",
      "of the Lucanian hills were guarded by his cavalry. They were betrayed by\n",
      "treachery or weakness; and the rapid march of the Goths scarcely allowed\n",
      "time for the escape of Belisarius to the coast of Sicily. At length a\n",
      "fleet and army were assembled for the relief of Ruscianum, or Rossano,\n",
      "a fortress sixty furlongs from the ruins of Sybaris, where the nobles\n",
      "of Lucania had taken refuge. In the first attempt, the Roman forces were\n",
      "dissipated by a storm. In the second, they approached the shore; but\n",
      "they saw the hills covered with archers, the landing-place defended by\n",
      "a line of spears, and the king of the Goths impatient for battle. The\n",
      "conqueror of Italy retired with a sigh, and continued to languish,\n",
      "inglorious and inactive, till Antonina, who had been sent to\n",
      "Constantinople to solicit succors, obtained, after the death of the\n",
      "empress, the permission of his return.\n",
      "\n",
      "The five last campaigns of Belisarius might abate the envy of his\n",
      "competitors, whose eyes had been dazzled and wounded by the blaze of\n",
      "his former glory. Instead of delivering Italy from the Goths, he had\n",
      "wandered like a fugitive along the coast, without daring to march into\n",
      "the country, or to accept the bold and repeated challenge of Totila.\n",
      "Yet, in the judgment of the few who could discriminate counsels from\n",
      "events, and compare the instruments with the execution, he appeared\n",
      "a more consummate master of the art of war, than in the season of his\n",
      "prosperity, when he presented two captive kings before the throne of\n",
      "Justinian. The valor of Belisarius was not chilled by age: his prudence\n",
      "was matured by experience; but the moral virtues of humanity and justice\n",
      "seem to have yielded to the hard necessity of the times. The parsimony\n",
      "or poverty of the emperor compelled him to deviate from the rule of\n",
      "conduct which had deserved the love and confidence of the Italians. The\n",
      "war was maintained by the oppression of Ravenna, Sicily, and all\n",
      "the faithful subjects of the empire; and the rigorous prosecution of\n",
      "Herodian provoked that injured or guilty officer to deliver Spoleto into\n",
      "the hands of the enemy. The avarice of Antonina, which had been some\n",
      "times diverted by love, now reigned without a rival in her breast.\n",
      "Belisarius himself had always understood, that riches, in a corrupt\n",
      "age, are the support and ornament of personal merit. And it cannot be\n",
      "presumed that he should stain his honor for the public service, without\n",
      "applying a part of the spoil to his private emolument. The hero had\n",
      "escaped the sword of the Barbarians. But the dagger of conspiracy\n",
      "awaited his return. In the midst of wealth and honors, Artaban, who had\n",
      "chastised the African tyrant, complained of the ingratitude of courts.\n",
      "He aspired to PrÊjecta, the emperor's niece, who wished to reward her\n",
      "deliverer; but the impediment of his previous marriage was asserted\n",
      "by the piety of Theodora. The pride of royal descent was irritated by\n",
      "flattery; and the service in which he gloried had proved him capable of\n",
      "bold and sanguinary deeds. The death of Justinian was resolved, but the\n",
      "conspirators delayed the execution till they could surprise Belisarius\n",
      "disarmed, and naked, in the palace of Constantinople. Not a hope could\n",
      "be entertained of shaking his long-tried fidelity; and they justly\n",
      "dreaded the revenge, or rather the justice, of the veteran general, who\n",
      "might speedily assemble an army in Thrace to punish the assassins, and\n",
      "perhaps to enjoy the fruits of their crime. Delay afforded time for rash\n",
      "communications and honest confessions: Artaban and his accomplices were\n",
      "condemned by the senate, but the extreme clemency of Justinian detained\n",
      "them in the gentle confinement of the palace, till he pardoned their\n",
      "flagitious attempt against his throne and life. If the emperor forgave\n",
      "his enemies, he must cordially embrace a friend whose victories were\n",
      "alone remembered, and who was endeared to his prince by the recent\n",
      "circumstances of their common danger. Belisarius reposed from his toils,\n",
      "in the high station of general of the East and count of the domestics;\n",
      "and the older consuls and patricians respectfully yielded the precedency\n",
      "of rank to the peerless merit of the first of the Romans. The first\n",
      "of the Romans still submitted to be the slave of his wife; but the\n",
      "servitude of habit and affection became less disgraceful when the death\n",
      "of Theodora had removed the baser influence of fear. Joannina, their\n",
      "daughter, and the sole heiress of their fortunes, was betrothed to\n",
      "Anastasius, the grandson, or rather the nephew, of the empress, whose\n",
      "kind interposition forwarded the consummation of their youthful loves.\n",
      "But the power of Theodora expired, the parents of Joannina returned, and\n",
      "her honor, perhaps her happiness, were sacrificed to the revenge of an\n",
      "unfeeling mother, who dissolved the imperfect nuptials before they had\n",
      "been ratified by the ceremonies of the church.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the departure of Belisarius, Perusia was besieged, and few cities\n",
      "were impregnable to the Gothic arms. Ravenna, Ancona, and Crotona, still\n",
      "resisted the Barbarians; and when Totila asked in marriage one of the\n",
      "daughters of France, he was stung by the just reproach that the king of\n",
      "Italy was unworthy of his title till it was acknowledged by the Roman\n",
      "people. Three thousand of the bravest soldiers had been left to\n",
      "defend the capital. On the suspicion of a monopoly, they massacred the\n",
      "governor, and announced to Justinian, by a deputation of the clergy,\n",
      "that unless their offence was pardoned, and their arrears were\n",
      "satisfied, they should instantly accept the tempting offers of Totila.\n",
      "But the officer who succeeded to the command (his name was Diogenes)\n",
      "deserved their esteem and confidence; and the Goths, instead of finding\n",
      "an easy conquest, encountered a vigorous resistance from the soldiers\n",
      "and people, who patiently endured the loss of the port and of all\n",
      "maritime supplies. The siege of Rome would perhaps have been raised,\n",
      "if the liberality of Totila to the Isaurians had not encouraged some of\n",
      "their venal countrymen to copy the example of treason. In a dark night,\n",
      "while the Gothic trumpets sounded on another side, they silently opened\n",
      "the gate of St. Paul: the Barbarians rushed into the city; and the\n",
      "flying garrison was intercepted before they could reach the harbor of\n",
      "CentumcellÊ. A soldier trained in the school of Belisarius, Paul of\n",
      "Cilicia, retired with four hundred men to the mole of Hadrian. They\n",
      "repelled the Goths; but they felt the approach of famine; and their\n",
      "aversion to the taste of horse-flesh confirmed their resolution to risk\n",
      "the event of a desperate and decisive sally. But their spirit insensibly\n",
      "stooped to the offers of capitulation; they retrieved their arrears of\n",
      "pay, and preserved their arms and horses, by enlisting in the service of\n",
      "Totila; their chiefs, who pleaded a laudable attachment to their wives\n",
      "and children in the East, were dismissed with honor; and above four\n",
      "hundred enemies, who had taken refuge in the sanctuaries, were saved\n",
      "by the clemency of the victor. He no longer entertained a wish of\n",
      "destroying the edifices of Rome, which he now respected as the seat\n",
      "of the Gothic kingdom: the senate and people were restored to their\n",
      "country; the means of subsistence were liberally provided; and Totila,\n",
      "in the robe of peace, exhibited the equestrian games of the circus.\n",
      "Whilst he amused the eyes of the multitude, four hundred vessels were\n",
      "prepared for the embarkation of his troops. The cities of Rhegium\n",
      "and Tarentum were reduced: he passed into Sicily, the object of his\n",
      "implacable resentment; and the island was stripped of its gold and\n",
      "silver, of the fruits of the earth, and of an infinite number of horses,\n",
      "sheep, and oxen. Sardinia and Corsica obeyed the fortune of Italy; and\n",
      "the sea-coast of Greece was visited by a fleet of three hundred galleys.\n",
      "The Goths were landed in Corcyra and the ancient continent of Epirus;\n",
      "they advanced as far as Nicopolis, the trophy of Augustus, and Dodona,\n",
      "once famous by the oracle of Jove. In every step of his victories, the\n",
      "wise Barbarian repeated to Justinian the desire of peace, applauded the\n",
      "concord of their predecessors, and offered to employ the Gothic arms in\n",
      "the service of the empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justinian was deaf to the voice of peace: but he neglected the\n",
      "prosecution of war; and the indolence of his temper disappointed, in\n",
      "some degree, the obstinacy of his passions. From this salutary slumber\n",
      "the emperor was awakened by the pope Vigilius and the patrician\n",
      "Cethegus, who appeared before his throne, and adjured him, in the name\n",
      "of God and the people, to resume the conquest and deliverance of Italy.\n",
      "In the choice of the generals, caprice, as well as judgment, was shown.\n",
      "A fleet and army sailed for the relief of Sicily, under the conduct\n",
      "of Liberius; but his youth and want of experience were afterwards\n",
      "discovered, and before he touched the shores of the island he was\n",
      "overtaken by his successor. In the place of Liberius, the conspirator\n",
      "Artaban was raised from a prison to military honors; in the pious\n",
      "presumption, that gratitude would animate his valor and fortify his\n",
      "allegiance. Belisarius reposed in the shade of his laurels, but the\n",
      "command of the principal army was reserved for Germanus, the emperor's\n",
      "nephew, whose rank and merit had been long depressed by the jealousy of\n",
      "the court. Theodora had injured him in the rights of a private citizen,\n",
      "the marriage of his children, and the testament of his brother; and\n",
      "although his conduct was pure and blameless, Justinian was displeased\n",
      "that he should be thought worthy of the confidence of the malecontents.\n",
      "The life of Germanus was a lesson of implicit obedience: he nobly\n",
      "refused to prostitute his name and character in the factions of\n",
      "the circus: the gravity of his manners was tempered by innocent\n",
      "cheerfulness; and his riches were lent without interest to indigent or\n",
      "deserving friends. His valor had formerly triumphed over the Sclavonians\n",
      "of the Danube and the rebels of Africa: the first report of his\n",
      "promotion revived the hopes of the Italians; and he was privately\n",
      "assured, that a crowd of Roman deserters would abandon, on his approach,\n",
      "the standard of Totila. His second marriage with Malasontha, the\n",
      "granddaughter of Theodoric endeared Germanus to the Goths themselves;\n",
      "and they marched with reluctance against the father of a royal infant\n",
      "the last offspring of the line of Amali. A splendid allowance was\n",
      "assigned by the emperor: the general contribute his private fortune: his\n",
      "two sons were popular and active and he surpassed, in the promptitude\n",
      "and success of his levies the expectation of mankind. He was permitted\n",
      "to select some squadrons of Thracian cavalry: the veterans, as well as\n",
      "the youth of Constantinople and Europe, engaged their voluntary service;\n",
      "and as far as the heart of Germany, his fame and liberality attracted\n",
      "the aid of the Barbarians. The Romans advanced to Sardica; an army of\n",
      "Sclavonians fled before their march; but within two days of their final\n",
      "departure, the designs of Germanus were terminated by his malady and\n",
      "death. Yet the impulse which he had given to the Italian war still\n",
      "continued to act with energy and effect. The maritime towns Ancona,\n",
      "Crotona, CentumcellÊ, resisted the assaults of Totila Sicily was reduced\n",
      "by the zeal of Artaban, and the Gothic navy was defeated near the coast\n",
      "of the Adriatic. The two fleets were almost equal, forty-seven to fifty\n",
      "galleys: the victory was decided by the knowledge and dexterity of the\n",
      "Greeks; but the ships were so closely grappled, that only twelve of\n",
      "the Goths escaped from this unfortunate conflict. They affected to\n",
      "depreciate an element in which they were unskilled; but their own\n",
      "experience confirmed the truth of a maxim, that the master of the sea\n",
      "will always acquire the dominion of the land.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the loss of Germanus, the nations were provoked to smile, by the\n",
      "strange intelligence, that the command of the Roman armies was given to\n",
      "a eunuch. But the eunuch Narses is ranked among the few who have rescued\n",
      "that unhappy name from the contempt and hatred of mankind. A feeble,\n",
      "diminutive body concealed the soul of a statesman and a warrior. His\n",
      "youth had been employed in the management of the loom and distaff, in\n",
      "the cares of the household, and the service of female luxury; but while\n",
      "his hands were busy, he secretly exercised the faculties of a vigorous\n",
      "and discerning mind. A stranger to the schools and the camp, he studied\n",
      "in the palace to dissemble, to flatter, and to persuade; and as soon\n",
      "as he approached the person of the emperor, Justinian listened with\n",
      "surprise and pleasure to the manly counsels of his chamberlain and\n",
      "private treasurer. The talents of Narses were tried and improved in\n",
      "frequent embassies: he led an army into Italy acquired a practical\n",
      "knowledge of the war and the country, and presumed to strive with the\n",
      "genius of Belisarius. Twelve years after his return, the eunuch was\n",
      "chosen to achieve the conquest which had been left imperfect by the\n",
      "first of the Roman generals. Instead of being dazzled by vanity or\n",
      "emulation, he seriously declared that, unless he were armed with an\n",
      "adequate force, he would never consent to risk his own glory and that\n",
      "of his sovereign. Justinian granted to the favorite what he might have\n",
      "denied to the hero: the Gothic war was rekindled from its ashes, and the\n",
      "preparations were not unworthy of the ancient majesty of the empire. The\n",
      "key of the public treasure was put into his hand, to collect magazines,\n",
      "to levy soldiers, to purchase arms and horses, to discharge the arrears\n",
      "of pay, and to tempt the fidelity of the fugitives and deserters. The\n",
      "troops of Germanus were still in arms; they halted at Salona in the\n",
      "expectation of a new leader; and legions of subjects and allies were\n",
      "created by the well-known liberality of the eunuch Narses. The king\n",
      "of the Lombards satisfied or surpassed the obligations of a treaty,\n",
      "by lending two thousand two hundred of his bravest warriors, who were\n",
      "followed by three thousand of their martial attendants. Three thousand\n",
      "Heruli fought on horseback under Philemuth, their native chief; and the\n",
      "noble Aratus, who adopted the manners and discipline of Rome, conducted\n",
      "a band of veterans of the same nation. Dagistheus was released from\n",
      "prison to command the Huns; and Kobad, the grandson and nephew of\n",
      "the great king, was conspicuous by the regal tiara at the head of his\n",
      "faithful Persians, who had devoted themselves to the fortunes of their\n",
      "prince. Absolute in the exercise of his authority, more absolute in the\n",
      "affection of his troops, Narses led a numerous and gallant army from\n",
      "Philippopolis to Salona, from whence he coasted the eastern side of the\n",
      "Adriatic as far as the confines of Italy. His progress was checked. The\n",
      "East could not supply vessels capable of transporting such multitudes of\n",
      "men and horses. The Franks, who, in the general confusion, had usurped\n",
      "the greater part of the Venetian province, refused a free passage to the\n",
      "friends of the Lombards. The station of Verona was occupied by Teias,\n",
      "with the flower of the Gothic forces; and that skilful commander\n",
      "had overspread the adjacent country with the fall of woods and the\n",
      "inundation of waters. In this perplexity, an officer of experience\n",
      "proposed a measure, secure by the appearance of rashness; that the\n",
      "Roman army should cautiously advance along the seashore, while the fleet\n",
      "preceded their march, and successively cast a bridge of boats over the\n",
      "mouths of the rivers, the Timavus, the Brenta, the Adige, and the\n",
      "Po, that fall into the Adriatic to the north of Ravenna. Nine days he\n",

      "The prudence of Narses impelled him to speedy and decisive action.\n",
      "His powers were the last effort of the state; the cost of each day\n",
      "accumulated the enormous account; and the nations, untrained to\n",
      "discipline or fatigue, might be rashly provoked to turn their arms\n",
      "against each other, or against their benefactor. The same considerations\n",
      "might have tempered the ardor of Totila. But he was conscious that the\n",
      "clergy and people of Italy aspired to a second revolution: he felt or\n",
      "suspected the rapid progress of treason; and he resolved to risk the\n",
      "Gothic kingdom on the chance of a day, in which the valiant would be\n",
      "animated by instant danger and the disaffected might be awed by mutual\n",
      "ignorance. In his march from Ravenna, the Roman general chastised the\n",
      "garrison of Rimini, traversed in a direct line the hills of Urbino, and\n",
      "reentered the Flaminian way, nine miles beyond the perforated rock,\n",
      "an obstacle of art and nature which might have stopped or retarded his\n",
      "progress. The Goths were assembled in the neighborhood of Rome, they\n",
      "advanced without delay to seek a superior enemy, and the two armies\n",
      "approached each other at the distance of one hundred furlongs, between\n",
      "Tagina and the sepulchres of the Gauls. The haughty message of Narses\n",
      "was an offer, not of peace, but of pardon. The answer of the Gothic\n",
      "king declared his resolution to die or conquer. \"What day,\" said the\n",
      "messenger, \"will you fix for the combat?\" \"The eighth day,\" replied\n",
      "Totila; but early the next morning he attempted to surprise a foe,\n",
      "suspicious of deceit, and prepared for battle. Ten thousand Heruli\n",
      "and Lombards, of approved valor and doubtful faith, were placed in the\n",
      "centre. Each of the wings was composed of eight thousand Romans; the\n",
      "right was guarded by the cavalry of the Huns, the left was covered by\n",
      "fifteen hundred chosen horse, destined, according to the emergencies\n",
      "of action, to sustain the retreat of their friends, or to encompass the\n",
      "flank of the enemy. From his proper station at the head of the right\n",
      "wing, the eunuch rode along the line, expressing by his voice and\n",
      "countenance the assurance of victory; exciting the soldiers of the\n",
      "emperor to punish the guilt and madness of a band of robbers; and\n",
      "exposing to their view gold chains, collars, and bracelets, the rewards\n",
      "of military virtue. From the event of a single combat they drew an omen\n",
      "of success; and they beheld with pleasure the courage of fifty archers,\n",
      "who maintained a small eminence against three successive attacks of the\n",
      "Gothic cavalry. At the distance only of two bow-shots, the armies spent\n",
      "the morning in dreadful suspense, and the Romans tasted some necessary\n",
      "food, without unloosing the cuirass from their breast, or the bridle\n",
      "from their horses. Narses awaited the charge; and it was delayed by\n",
      "Totila till he had received his last succors of two thousand Goths.\n",
      "While he consumed the hours in fruitless treaty, the king exhibited in\n",
      "a narrow space the strength and agility of a warrior. His armor was\n",
      "enchased with gold; his purple banner floated with the wind: he cast\n",
      "his lance into the air; caught it with the right hand; shifted it to the\n",
      "left; threw himself backwards; recovered his seat; and managed a fiery\n",
      "steed in all the paces and evolutions of the equestrian school. As soon\n",
      "as the succors had arrived, he retired to his tent, assumed the dress\n",
      "and arms of a private soldier, and gave the signal of a battle. The\n",
      "first line of cavalry advanced with more courage than discretion, and\n",
      "left behind them the infantry of the second line. They were soon engaged\n",
      "between the horns of a crescent, into which the adverse wings had been\n",
      "insensibly curved, and were saluted from either side by the volleys of\n",
      "four thousand archers. Their ardor, and even their distress, drove them\n",
      "forwards to a close and unequal conflict, in which they could only use\n",
      "their lances against an enemy equally skilled in all the instruments\n",
      "of war. A generous emulation inspired the Romans and their Barbarian\n",
      "allies; and Narses, who calmly viewed and directed their efforts,\n",
      "doubted to whom he should adjudge the prize of superior bravery. The\n",
      "Gothic cavalry was astonished and disordered, pressed and broken; and\n",
      "the line of infantry, instead of presenting their spears, or opening\n",
      "their intervals, were trampled under the feet of the flying horse. Six\n",
      "thousand of the Goths were slaughtered without mercy in the field of\n",
      "Tagina. Their prince, with five attendants, was overtaken by Asbad,\n",
      "of the race of the GepidÊ. \"Spare the king of Italy,\" cried a loyal\n",
      "voice, and Asbad struck his lance through the body of Totila. The blow\n",
      "was instantly revenged by the faithful Goths: they transported their\n",
      "dying monarch seven miles beyond the scene of his disgrace; and his\n",
      "last moments were not imbittered by the presence of an enemy. Compassion\n",
      "afforded him the shelter of an obscure tomb; but the Romans were not\n",
      "satisfied of their victory, till they beheld the corpse of the Gothic\n",
      "king. His hat, enriched with gems, and his bloody robe, were presented\n",
      "to Justinian by the messengers of triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Narses had paid his devotions to the Author of victory, and\n",
      "the blessed Virgin, his peculiar patroness, he praised, rewarded, and\n",
      "dismissed the Lombards. The villages had been reduced to ashes by these\n",
      "valiant savages; they ravished matrons and virgins on the altar; their\n",
      "retreat was diligently watched by a strong detachment of regular forces,\n",
      "who prevented a repetition of the like disorders. The victorious eunuch\n",
      "pursued his march through Tuscany, accepted the submission of the Goths,\n",
      "heard the acclamations, and often the complaints, of the Italians, and\n",
      "encompassed the walls of Rome with the remainder of his formidable host.\n",
      "Round the wide circumference, Narses assigned to himself, and to each\n",
      "of his lieutenants, a real or a feigned attack, while he silently marked\n",
      "the place of easy and unguarded entrance. Neither the fortifications of\n",
      "Hadrian's mole, nor of the port, could long delay the progress of the\n",
      "conqueror; and Justinian once more received the keys of Rome, which,\n",
      "under his reign, had been five times taken and recovered. But the\n",
      "deliverance of Rome was the last calamity of the Roman people. The\n",
      "Barbarian allies of Narses too frequently confounded the privileges of\n",
      "peace and war. The despair of the flying Goths found some consolation\n",
      "in sanguinary revenge; and three hundred youths of the noblest families,\n",
      "who had been sent as hostages beyond the Po, were inhumanly slain by the\n",
      "successor of Totila. The fate of the senate suggests an awful lesson\n",
      "of the vicissitude of human affairs. Of the senators whom Totila\n",
      "had banished from their country, some were rescued by an officer of\n",
      "Belisarius, and transported from Campania to Sicily; while others were\n",
      "too guilty to confide in the clemency of Justinian, or too poor to\n",
      "provide horses for their escape to the sea-shore. Their brethren\n",
      "languished five years in a state of indigence and exile: the victory of\n",
      "Narses revived their hopes; but their premature return to the metropolis\n",
      "was prevented by the furious Goths; and all the fortresses of Campania\n",
      "were stained with patrician blood. After a period of thirteen centuries,\n",
      "the institution of Romulus expired; and if the nobles of Rome still\n",
      "assumed the title of senators, few subsequent traces can be discovered\n",
      "of a public council, or constitutional order. Ascend six hundred years,\n",
      "and contemplate the kings of the earth soliciting an audience, as the\n",
      "slaves or freedmen of the Roman senate!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gothic war was yet alive. The bravest of the nation retired beyond\n",
      "the Po; and Teias was unanimously chosen to succeed and revenge their\n",
      "departed hero. The new king immediately sent ambassadors to implore, or\n",
      "rather to purchase, the aid of the Franks, and nobly lavished, for the\n",
      "public safety, the riches which had been deposited in the palace of\n",
      "Pavia. The residue of the royal treasure was guarded by his brother\n",
      "Aligern, at CumÊa, in Campania; but the strong castle which Totila had\n",
      "fortified was closely besieged by the arms of Narses. From the Alps\n",
      "to the foot of Mount Vesuvius, the Gothic king, by rapid and secret\n",
      "marches, advanced to the relief of his brother, eluded the vigilance\n",
      "of the Roman chiefs, and pitched his camp on the banks of the Sarnus\n",
      "or _Draco_, which flows from Nuceria into the Bay of Naples. The river\n",
      "separated the two armies: sixty days were consumed in distant and\n",
      "fruitless combats, and Teias maintained this important post till he was\n",
      "deserted by his fleet and the hope of subsistence. With reluctant steps\n",
      "he ascended the _Lactarian_ mount, where the physicians of Rome, since\n",
      "the time of Galen, had sent their patients for the benefit of the air\n",
      "and the milk. But the Goths soon embraced a more generous resolution:\n",
      "to descend the hill, to dismiss their horses, and to die in arms, and\n",
      "in the possession of freedom. The king marched at their head, bearing in\n",
      "his right hand a lance, and an ample buckler in his left: with the\n",
      "one he struck dead the foremost of the assailants; with the other he\n",
      "received the weapons which every hand was ambitious to aim against his\n",
      "life. After a combat of many hours, his left arm was fatigued by the\n",
      "weight of twelve javelins which hung from his shield. Without moving\n",
      "from his ground, or suspending his blows, the hero called aloud on his\n",
      "attendants for a fresh buckler; but in the moment while his side was\n",
      "uncovered, it was pierced by a mortal dart. He fell; and his head,\n",
      "exalted on a spear, proclaimed to the nations that the Gothic kingdom\n",
      "was no more. But the example of his death served only to animate the\n",
      "companions who had sworn to perish with their leader. They fought till\n",
      "darkness descended on the earth. They reposed on their arms. The combat\n",
      "was renewed with the return of light, and maintained with unabated vigor\n",
      "till the evening of the second day. The repose of a second night, the\n",
      "want of water, and the loss of their bravest champions, determined the\n",
      "surviving Goths to accept the fair capitulation which the prudence\n",
      "of Narses was inclined to propose. They embraced the alternative\n",
      "of residing in Italy, as the subjects and soldiers of Justinian, or\n",
      "departing with a portion of their private wealth, in search of some\n",
      "independent country. Yet the oath of fidelity or exile was alike\n",
      "rejected by one thousand Goths, who broke away before the treaty was\n",
      "signed, and boldly effected their retreat to the walls of Pavia. The\n",
      "spirit, as well as the situation, of Aligern prompted him to imitate\n",
      "rather than to bewail his brother: a strong and dexterous archer, he\n",
      "transpierced with a single arrow the armor and breast of his antagonist;\n",
      "and his military conduct defended CumÊ above a year against the forces\n",
      "of the Romans. Their industry had scooped the Sibyl's cave into a\n",
      "prodigious mine; combustible materials were introduced to consume the\n",
      "temporary props: the wall and the gate of CumÊ sunk into the cavern, but\n",
      "the ruins formed a deep and inaccessible precipice. On the fragment of\n",
      "a rock Aligern stood alone and unshaken, till he calmly surveyed the\n",
      "hopeless condition of his country, and judged it more honorable to be\n",
      "the friend of Narses, than the slave of the Franks. After the death of\n",
      "Teias, the Roman general separated his troops to reduce the cities\n",
      "of Italy; Lucca sustained a long and vigorous siege: and such was the\n",
      "humanity or the prudence of Narses, that the repeated perfidy of the\n",
      "inhabitants could not provoke him to exact the forfeit lives of their\n",
      "hostages. These hostages were dismissed in safety; and their grateful\n",
      "zeal at length subdued the obstinacy of their countrymen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Lucca had surrendered, Italy was overwhelmed by a new deluge of\n",
      "Barbarians. A feeble youth, the grandson of Clovis, reigned over the\n",
      "Austrasians or oriental Franks. The guardians of Theodebald entertained\n",
      "with coldness and reluctance the magnificent promises of the Gothic\n",
      "ambassadors. But the spirit of a martial people outstripped the timid\n",
      "counsels of the court: two brothers, Lothaire and Buccelin, the dukes\n",
      "of the Alemanni, stood forth as the leaders of the Italian war; and\n",
      "seventy-five thousand Germans descended in the autumn from the RhÊtian\n",
      "Alps into the plain of Milan. The vanguard of the Roman army was\n",
      "stationed near the Po, under the conduct of Fulcaris, a bold Herulian,\n",
      "who rashly conceived that personal bravery was the sole duty and merit\n",
      "of a commander. As he marched without order or precaution along the\n",
      "∆milian way, an ambuscade of Franks suddenly rose from the amphitheatre\n",
      "of Parma; his troops were surprised and routed; but their leader refused\n",
      "to fly; declaring to the last moment, that death was less terrible\n",
      "than the angry countenance of Narses. The death of Fulcaris, and the\n",
      "retreat of the surviving chiefs, decided the fluctuating and rebellious\n",
      "temper of the Goths; they flew to the standard of their deliverers, and\n",
      "admitted them into the cities which still resisted the arms of the\n",
      "Roman general. The conqueror of Italy opened a free passage to the\n",
      "irresistible torrent of Barbarians. They passed under the walls of\n",
      "Cesena, and answered by threats and reproaches the advice of Aligern,\n",
      "that the Gothic treasures could no longer repay the labor of an\n",
      "invasion. Two thousand Franks were destroyed by the skill and valor\n",
      "of Narses himself, who sailed from Rimini at the head of three hundred\n",
      "horse, to chastise the licentious rapine of their march. On the confines\n",
      "of Samnium the two brothers divided their forces. With the right wing,\n",
      "Buccelin assumed the spoil of Campania, Lucania, and Bruttium; with\n",
      "the left, Lothaire accepted the plunder of Apulia and Calabria. They\n",
      "followed the coast of the Mediterranean and the Adriatic, as far as\n",
      "Rhegium and Otranto, and the extreme lands of Italy were the term\n",
      "of their destructive progress. The Franks, who were Christians and\n",
      "Catholics, contented themselves with simple pillage and occasional\n",
      "murder. But the churches which their piety had spared, were stripped by\n",
      "the sacrilegious hands of the Alamanni, who sacrificed horses' heads to\n",
      "their native deities of the woods and rivers; they melted or profaned\n",
      "the consecrated vessels, and the ruins of shrines and altars were\n",
      "stained with the blood of the faithful. Buccelin was actuated by\n",
      "ambition, and Lothaire by avarice. The former aspired to restore the\n",
      "Gothic kingdom; the latter, after a promise to his brother of speedy\n",
      "succors, returned by the same road to deposit his treasure beyond the\n",
      "Alps. The strength of their armies was already wasted by the change of\n",
      "climate and contagion of disease: the Germans revelled in the vintage of\n",
      "Italy; and their own intemperance avenged, in some degree, the miseries\n",
      "of a defenceless people.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the entrance of the spring, the Imperial troops, who had guarded\n",
      "the cities, assembled, to the number of eighteen thousand men, in\n",
      "the neighborhood of Rome. Their winter hours had not been consumed\n",
      "in idleness. By the command, and after the example, of Narses, they\n",
      "repeated each day their military exercise on foot and on horseback,\n",
      "accustomed their ear to obey the sound of the trumpet, and practised the\n",
      "steps and evolutions of the Pyrrhic dance. From the Straits of Sicily,\n",
      "Buccelin, with thirty thousand Franks and Alamanni, slowly moved towards\n",
      "Capua, occupied with a wooden tower the bridge of Casilinum, covered\n",
      "his right by the stream of the Vulturnus, and secured the rest of his\n",
      "encampment by a rampart of sharp stakes, and a circle of wagons, whose\n",
      "wheels were buried in the earth. He impatiently expected the return of\n",
      "Lothaire; ignorant, alas! that his brother could never return, and that\n",
      "the chief and his army had been swept away by a strange disease on the\n",
      "banks of the Lake Benacus, between Trent and Verona. The banners\n",
      "of Narses soon approached the Vulturnus, and the eyes of Italy were\n",
      "anxiously fixed on the event of this final contest. Perhaps the talents\n",
      "of the Roman general were most conspicuous in the calm operations which\n",
      "precede the tumult of a battle. His skilful movements intercepted the\n",
      "subsistence of the Barbarian deprived him of the advantage of the bridge\n",
      "and river, and in the choice of the ground and moment of action reduced\n",
      "him to comply with the inclination of his enemy. On the morning of the\n",
      "important day, when the ranks were already formed, a servant, for some\n",
      "trivial fault, was killed by his master, one of the leaders of the\n",
      "Heruli. The justice or passion of Narses was awakened: he summoned the\n",
      "offender to his presence, and without listening to his excuses, gave the\n",
      "signal to the minister of death. If the cruel master had not infringed\n",
      "the laws of his nation, this arbitrary execution was not less unjust\n",
      "than it appears to have been imprudent. The Heruli felt the indignity;\n",
      "they halted: but the Roman general, without soothing their rage, or\n",
      "expecting their resolution, called aloud, as the trumpets sounded, that\n",
      "unless they hastened to occupy their place, they would lose the honor\n",
      "of the victory. His troops were disposed in a long front, the cavalry on\n",
      "the wings; in the centre, the heavy-armed foot; the archers and slingers\n",
      "in the rear. The Germans advanced in a sharp-pointed column, of the form\n",
      "of a triangle or solid wedge. They pierced the feeble centre of Narses,\n",
      "who received them with a smile into the fatal snare, and directed his\n",
      "wings of cavalry insensibly to wheel on their flanks and encompass their\n",
      "rear. The host of the Franks and Alamanni consisted of infantry: a\n",
      "sword and buckler hung by their side; and they used, as their weapons\n",
      "of offence, a weighty hatchet and a hooked javelin, which were only\n",
      "formidable in close combat, or at a short distance. The flower of the\n",
      "Roman archers, on horseback, and in complete armor, skirmished without\n",
      "peril round this immovable phalanx; supplied by active speed the\n",
      "deficiency of number; and aimed their arrows against a crowd of\n",
      "Barbarians, who, instead of a cuirass and helmet, were covered by a\n",
      "loose garment of fur or linen. They paused, they trembled, their ranks\n",
      "were confounded, and in the decisive moment the Heruli, preferring glory\n",
      "to revenge, charged with rapid violence the head of the column. Their\n",
      "leader, Sinbal, and Aligern, the Gothic prince, deserved the prize\n",
      "of superior valor; and their example excited the victorious troops to\n",
      "achieve with swords and spears the destruction of the enemy. Buccelin,\n",
      "and the greatest part of his army, perished on the field of battle, in\n",
      "the waters of the Vulturnus, or by the hands of the enraged peasants:\n",
      "but it may seem incredible, that a victory, which no more than five of\n",
      "the Alamanni survived, could be purchased with the loss of fourscore\n",
      "Romans. Seven thousand Goths, the relics of the war, defended the\n",
      "fortress of Campsa till the ensuing spring; and every messenger of\n",
      "Narses announced the reduction of the Italian cities, whose names were\n",
      "corrupted by the ignorance or vanity of the Greeks. After the battle\n",
      "of Casilinum, Narses entered the capital; the arms and treasures of the\n",
      "Goths, the Franks, and the Alamanni, were displayed; his soldiers, with\n",
      "garlands in their hands, chanted the praises of the conqueror; and Rome,\n",
      "for the last time, beheld the semblance of a triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a reign of sixty years, the throne of the Gothic kings was filled\n",
      "by the exarchs of Ravenna, the representatives in peace and war of the\n",
      "emperor of the Romans. Their jurisdiction was soon reduced to the limits\n",
      "of a narrow province: but Narses himself, the first and most powerful\n",
      "of the exarchs, administered above fifteen years the entire kingdom of\n",
      "Italy. Like Belisarius, he had deserved the honors of envy, calumny,\n",
      "and disgrace: but the favorite eunuch still enjoyed the confidence of\n",
      "Justinian; or the leader of a victorious army awed and repressed the\n",
      "ingratitude of a timid court. Yet it was not by weak and mischievous\n",
      "indulgence that Narses secured the attachment of his troops. Forgetful\n",
      "of the past, and regardless of the future, they abused the present hour\n",
      "of prosperity and peace. The cities of Italy resounded with the noise\n",
      "of drinking and dancing; the spoils of victory were wasted in sensual\n",
      "pleasures; and nothing (says Agathias) remained unless to exchange their\n",
      "shields and helmets for the soft lute and the capacious hogshead. In a\n",
      "manly oration, not unworthy of a Roman censor, the eunuch reproved these\n",
      "disorderly vices, which sullied their fame, and endangered their\n",
      "safety. The soldiers blushed and obeyed; discipline was confirmed; the\n",
      "fortifications were restored; a _duke_ was stationed for the defence and\n",
      "military command of each of the principal cities; and the eye of Narses\n",
      "pervaded the ample prospect from Calabria to the Alps. The remains of\n",
      "the Gothic nation evacuated the country, or mingled with the people; the\n",
      "Franks, instead of revenging the death of Buccelin, abandoned, without\n",
      "a struggle, their Italian conquests; and the rebellious Sinbal, chief\n",
      "of the Heruli, was subdued, taken and hung on a lofty gallows by the\n",
      "inflexible justice of the exarch. The civil state of Italy, after the\n",
      "agitation of a long tempest, was fixed by a pragmatic sanction, which\n",
      "the emperor promulgated at the request of the pope. Justinian introduced\n",
      "his own jurisprudence into the schools and tribunals of the West; he\n",
      "ratified the acts of Theodoric and his immediate successors, but every\n",
      "deed was rescinded and abolished which force had extorted, or fear had\n",
      "subscribed, under the usurpation of Totila. A moderate theory was framed\n",
      "to reconcile the rights of property with the safety of prescription, the\n",
      "claims of the state with the poverty of the people, and the pardon of\n",
      "offences with the interest of virtue and order of society. Under the\n",
      "exarchs of Ravenna, Rome was degraded to the second rank. Yet the\n",
      "senators were gratified by the permission of visiting their estates\n",
      "in Italy, and of approaching, without obstacle, the throne of\n",
      "Constantinople: the regulation of weights and measures was delegated\n",
      "to the pope and senate; and the salaries of lawyers and physicians, of\n",
      "orators and grammarians, were destined to preserve, or rekindle,\n",
      "the light of science in the ancient capital. Justinian might dictate\n",
      "benevolent edicts, and Narses might second his wishes by the restoration\n",
      "of cities, and more especially of churches. But the power of kings is\n",
      "most effectual to destroy; and the twenty years of the Gothic war had\n",
      "consummated the distress and depopulation of Italy. As early as the\n",
      "fourth campaign, under the discipline of Belisarius himself, fifty\n",
      "thousand laborers died of hunger in the narrow region of Picenum; and a\n",
      "strict interpretation of the evidence of Procopius would swell the loss\n",
      "of Italy above the total sum of her present inhabitants.\n",
      "\n",
      "I desire to believe, but I dare not affirm, that Belisarius sincerely\n",
      "rejoiced in the triumph of Narses. Yet the consciousness of his own\n",
      "exploits might teach him to esteem without jealousy the merit of a\n",
      "rival; and the repose of the aged warrior was crowned by a last victory,\n",
      "which saved the emperor and the capital. The Barbarians, who annually\n",
      "visited the provinces of Europe, were less discouraged by some\n",
      "accidental defeats, than they were excited by the double hope of spoil\n",
      "and of subsidy. In the thirty-second winter of Justinian's reign, the\n",
      "Danube was deeply frozen: Zabergan led the cavalry of the Bulgarians,\n",
      "and his standard was followed by a promiscuous multitude of Sclavonians.\n",
      "* The savage chief passed, without opposition, the river and the\n",
      "mountains, spread his troops over Macedonia and Thrace, and advanced\n",
      "with no more than seven thousand horse to the long wall, which should\n",
      "have defended the territory of Constantinople. But the works of man are\n",
      "impotent against the assaults of nature: a recent earthquake had shaken\n",
      "the foundations of the wall; and the forces of the empire were employed\n",
      "on the distant frontiers of Italy, Africa, and Persia. The seven\n",
      "_schools_, or companies of the guards or domestic troops, had been\n",
      "augmented to the number of five thousand five hundred men, whose\n",
      "ordinary station was in the peaceful cities of Asia. But the places\n",
      "of the brave Armenians were insensibly supplied by lazy citizens, who\n",
      "purchased an exemption from the duties of civil life, without being\n",
      "exposed to the dangers of military service. Of such soldiers, few could\n",
      "be tempted to sally from the gates; and none could be persuaded to\n",
      "remain in the field, unless they wanted strength and speed to escape\n",
      "from the Bulgarians. The report of the fugitives exaggerated the numbers\n",
      "and fierceness of an enemy, who had polluted holy virgins, and abandoned\n",
      "new-born infants to the dogs and vultures; a crowd of rustics, imploring\n",
      "food and protection, increased the consternation of the city, and the\n",
      "tents of Zabergan were pitched at the distance of twenty miles, on the\n",
      "banks of a small river, which encircles Melanthias, and afterwards falls\n",
      "into the Propontis. Justinian trembled: and those who had only seen the\n",
      "emperor in his old age, were pleased to suppose, that he had _lost_ the\n",
      "alacrity and vigor of his youth. By his command the vessels of gold and\n",
      "silver were removed from the churches in the neighborhood, and even\n",
      "the suburbs, of Constantinople; the ramparts were lined with trembling\n",
      "spectators; the golden gate was crowded with useless generals and\n",
      "tribunes, and the senate shared the fatigues and the apprehensions of\n",
      "the populace.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the eyes of the prince and people were directed to a feeble veteran,\n",
      "who was compelled by the public danger to resume the armor in which he\n",
      "had entered Carthage and defended Rome. The horses of the royal stables,\n",
      "of private citizens, and even of the circus, were hastily collected; the\n",
      "emulation of the old and young was roused by the name of Belisarius,\n",
      "and his first encampment was in the presence of a victorious enemy. His\n",
      "prudence, and the labor of the friendly peasants, secured, with a ditch\n",
      "and rampart, the repose of the night; innumerable fires, and clouds of\n",
      "dust, were artfully contrived to magnify the opinion of his strength;\n",
      "his soldiers suddenly passed from despondency to presumption; and,\n",
      "while ten thousand voices demanded the battle, Belisarius dissembled his\n",
      "knowledge, that in the hour of trial he must depend on the firmness of\n",
      "three hundred veterans. The next morning the Bulgarian cavalry advanced\n",
      "to the charge. But they heard the shouts of multitudes, they beheld the\n",
      "arms and discipline of the front; they were assaulted on the flanks by\n",
      "two ambuscades which rose from the woods; their foremost warriors fell\n",
      "by the hand of the aged hero and his guards; and the swiftness of their\n",
      "evolutions was rendered useless by the close attack and rapid pursuit of\n",
      "the Romans. In this action (so speedy was their flight) the Bulgarians\n",
      "lost only four hundred horse; but Constantinople was saved; and\n",
      "Zabergan, who felt the hand of a master, withdrew to a respectful\n",
      "distance. But his friends were numerous in the councils of the\n",
      "emperor, and Belisarius obeyed with reluctance the commands of envy and\n",
      "Justinian, which forbade him to achieve the deliverance of his country.\n",
      "On his return to the city, the people, still conscious of their danger,\n",
      "accompanied his triumph with acclamations of joy and gratitude, which\n",
      "were imputed as a crime to the victorious general. But when he entered\n",
      "the palace, the courtiers were silent, and the emperor, after a cold and\n",
      "thankless embrace, dismissed him to mingle with the train of slaves.\n",
      "Yet so deep was the impression of his glory on the minds of men, that\n",
      "Justinian, in the seventy-seventh year of his age, was encouraged to\n",
      "advance near forty miles from the capital, and to inspect in person the\n",
      "restoration of the long wall. The Bulgarians wasted the summer in the\n",
      "plains of Thrace; but they were inclined to peace by the failure of\n",
      "their rash attempts on Greece and the Chersonesus. A menace of killing\n",
      "their prisoners quickened the payment of heavy ransoms; and the\n",
      "departure of Zabergan was hastened by the report, that double-prowed\n",
      "vessels were built on the Danube to intercept his passage. The danger\n",
      "was soon forgotten; and a vain question, whether their sovereign had\n",

      "Chapter XLIII: Last Victory And Death Of Belisarius, Death Of Justinian.--Part IV.\n",
      "\n",
      "About two years after the last victory of Belisarius, the emperor\n",
      "returned from a Thracian journey of health, or business, or devotion.\n",
      "Justinian was afflicted by a pain in his head; and his private entry\n",
      "countenanced the rumor of his death. Before the third hour of the day,\n",
      "the bakers' shops were plundered of their bread, the houses were shut,\n",
      "and every citizen, with hope or terror, prepared for the impending\n",
      "tumult. The senators themselves, fearful and suspicious, were convened\n",
      "at the ninth hour; and the prÊfect received their commands to visit\n",
      "every quarter of the city, and proclaim a general illumination for\n",
      "the recovery of the emperor's health. The ferment subsided; but every\n",
      "accident betrayed the impotence of the government, and the factious\n",
      "temper of the people: the guards were disposed to mutiny as often as\n",
      "their quarters were changed, or their pay was withheld: the frequent\n",
      "calamities of fires and earthquakes afforded the opportunities of\n",
      "disorder; the disputes of the blues and greens, of the orthodox and\n",
      "heretics, degenerated into bloody battles; and, in the presence of the\n",
      "Persian ambassador, Justinian blushed for himself and for his subjects.\n",
      "Capricious pardon and arbitrary punishment imbittered the irksomeness\n",
      "and discontent of a long reign: a conspiracy was formed in the palace;\n",
      "and, unless we are deceived by the names of Marcellus and Sergius, the\n",
      "most virtuous and the most profligate of the courtiers were associated\n",
      "in the same designs. They had fixed the time of the execution; their\n",
      "rank gave them access to the royal banquet; and their black slaves were\n",
      "stationed in the vestibule and porticos, to announce the death of the\n",
      "tyrant, and to excite a sedition in the capital. But the indiscretion\n",
      "of an accomplice saved the poor remnant of the days of Justinian. The\n",
      "conspirators were detected and seized, with daggers hidden under their\n",
      "garments: Marcellus died by his own hand, and Sergius was dragged from\n",
      "the sanctuary. Pressed by remorse, or tempted by the hopes of safety, he\n",
      "accused two officers of the household of Belisarius; and torture forced\n",
      "them to declare that they had acted according to the secret instructions\n",
      "of their patron. Posterity will not hastily believe that a hero who,\n",
      "in the vigor of life, had disdained the fairest offers of ambition and\n",
      "revenge, should stoop to the murder of his prince, whom he could not\n",
      "long expect to survive. His followers were impatient to fly; but flight\n",
      "must have been supported by rebellion, and he had lived enough for\n",
      "nature and for glory. Belisarius appeared before the council with less\n",
      "fear than indignation: after forty years' service, the emperor had\n",
      "prejudged his guilt; and injustice was sanctified by the presence\n",
      "and authority of the patriarch. The life of Belisarius was graciously\n",
      "spared; but his fortunes were sequestered, and, from December to July,\n",
      "he was guarded as a prisoner in his own palace. At length his innocence\n",
      "was acknowledged; his freedom and honor were restored; and death, which\n",
      "might be hastened by resentment and grief, removed him from the world\n",
      "in about eight months after his deliverance. The name of Belisarius can\n",
      "never die but instead of the funeral, the monuments, the statues, so\n",
      "justly due to his memory, I only read, that his treasures, the spoil of\n",
      "the Goths and Vandals, were immediately confiscated by the emperor. Some\n",
      "decent portion was reserved, however for the use of his widow: and as\n",
      "Antonina had much to repent, she devoted the last remains of her life\n",
      "and fortune to the foundation of a convent. Such is the simple and\n",
      "genuine narrative of the fall of Belisarius and the ingratitude of\n",
      "Justinian. That he was deprived of his eyes, and reduced by envy to beg\n",
      "his bread, \"Give a penny to Belisarius the general!\" is a fiction of\n",
      "later times, which has obtained credit, or rather favor, as a strange\n",
      "example of the vicissitudes of fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the emperor could rejoice in the death of Belisarius, he enjoyed\n",
      "the base satisfaction only eight months, the last period of a reign\n",
      "of thirty-eight years, and a life of eighty-three years. It would\n",
      "be difficult to trace the character of a prince who is not the most\n",
      "conspicuous object of his own times: but the confessions of an enemy may\n",
      "be received as the safest evidence of his virtues. The resemblance\n",
      "of Justinian to the bust of Domitian, is maliciously urged; with\n",
      "the acknowledgment, however, of a well-proportioned figure, a ruddy\n",
      "complexion, and a pleasing countenance. The emperor was easy of access,\n",
      "patient of hearing, courteous and affable in discourse, and a master\n",
      "of the angry passions which rage with such destructive violence in the\n",
      "breast of a despot. Procopius praises his temper, to reproach him with\n",
      "calm and deliberate cruelty: but in the conspiracies which attacked his\n",
      "authority and person, a more candid judge will approve the justice, or\n",
      "admire the clemency, of Justinian. He excelled in the private virtues\n",
      "of chastity and temperance: but the impartial love of beauty would have\n",
      "been less mischievous than his conjugal tenderness for Theodora; and his\n",
      "abstemious diet was regulated, not by the prudence of a philosopher, but\n",
      "the superstition of a monk. His repasts were short and frugal: on solemn\n",
      "fasts, he contented himself with water and vegetables; and such was his\n",
      "strength, as well as fervor, that he frequently passed two days, and as\n",
      "many nights, without tasting any food. The measure of his sleep was not\n",
      "less rigorous: after the repose of a single hour, the body was awakened\n",
      "by the soul, and, to the astonishment of his chamberlain, Justinian\n",
      "walked or studied till the morning light. Such restless application\n",
      "prolonged his time for the acquisition of knowledge and the despatch of\n",
      "business; and he might seriously deserve the reproach of confounding,\n",
      "by minute and preposterous diligence, the general order of his\n",
      "administration. The emperor professed himself a musician and architect,\n",
      "a poet and philosopher, a lawyer and theologian; and if he failed in the\n",
      "enterprise of reconciling the Christian sects, the review of the Roman\n",
      "jurisprudence is a noble monument of his spirit and industry. In the\n",
      "government of the empire, he was less wise, or less successful: the age\n",
      "was unfortunate; the people was oppressed and discontented; Theodora\n",
      "abused her power; a succession of bad ministers disgraced his judgment;\n",
      "and Justinian was neither beloved in his life, nor regretted at his\n",
      "death. The love of fame was deeply implanted in his breast, but he\n",
      "condescended to the poor ambition of titles, honors, and contemporary\n",
      "praise; and while he labored to fix the admiration, he forfeited the\n",
      "esteem and affection, of the Romans. The design of the African and\n",
      "Italian wars was boldly conceived and executed; and his penetration\n",
      "discovered the talents of Belisarius in the camp, of Narses in the\n",
      "palace. But the name of the emperor is eclipsed by the names of his\n",
      "victorious generals; and Belisarius still lives, to upbraid the envy and\n",
      "ingratitude of his sovereign. The partial favor of mankind applauds\n",
      "the genius of a conqueror, who leads and directs his subjects in the\n",
      "exercise of arms. The characters of Philip the Second and of Justinian\n",
      "are distinguished by the cold ambition which delights in war, and\n",
      "declines the dangers of the field. Yet a colossal statue of bronze\n",
      "represented the emperor on horseback, preparing to march against the\n",
      "Persians in the habit and armor of Achilles. In the great square before\n",
      "the church of St. Sophia, this monument was raised on a brass column\n",
      "and a stone pedestal of seven steps; and the pillar of Theodosius, which\n",
      "weighed seven thousand four hundred pounds of silver, was removed from\n",
      "the same place by the avarice and vanity of Justinian. Future princes\n",
      "were more just or indulgent to _his_ memory; the elder Andronicus, in\n",
      "the beginning of the fourteenth century, repaired and beautified his\n",
      "equestrian statue: since the fall of the empire it has been melted into\n",
      "cannon by the victorious Turks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall conclude this chapter with the comets, the earthquakes, and the\n",
      "plague, which astonished or afflicted the age of Justinian.\n",
      "\n",
      "I. In the fifth year of his reign, and in the month of September, a\n",
      "comet was seen during twenty days in the western quarter of the heavens,\n",
      "and which shot its rays into the north. Eight years afterwards, while\n",
      "the sun was in Capricorn, another comet appeared to follow in the\n",
      "Sagittary; the size was gradually increasing; the head was in the east,\n",
      "the tail in the west, and it remained visible above forty days. The\n",
      "nations, who gazed with astonishment, expected wars and calamities\n",
      "from their baleful influence; and these expectations were abundantly\n",
      "fulfilled. The astronomers dissembled their ignorance of the nature of\n",
      "these blazing stars, which they affected to represent as the floating\n",
      "meteors of the air; and few among them embraced the simple notion of\n",
      "Seneca and the Chaldeans, that they are only planets of a longer\n",
      "period and more eccentric motion. Time and science have justified the\n",
      "conjectures and predictions of the Roman sage: the telescope has opened\n",
      "new worlds to the eyes of astronomers; and, in the narrow space of\n",
      "history and fable, one and the same comet is already found to have\n",
      "revisited the earth in _seven_ equal revolutions of five hundred and\n",
      "seventy-five years. The _first_, which ascends beyond the Christian Êra\n",
      "one thousand seven hundred and sixty-seven years, is coeval with Ogyges,\n",
      "the father of Grecian antiquity. And this appearance explains the\n",
      "tradition which Varro has preserved, that under his reign the planet\n",
      "Venus changed her color, size, figure, and course; a prodigy without\n",
      "example either in past or succeeding ages. The _second_ visit, in the\n",
      "year eleven hundred and ninety-three, is darkly implied in the fable of\n",
      "Electra, the seventh of the Pleiads, who have been reduced to six since\n",
      "the time of the Trojan war. That nymph, the wife of Dardanus, was unable\n",
      "to support the ruin of her country: she abandoned the dances of her\n",
      "sister orbs, fled from the zodiac to the north pole, and obtained,\n",
      "from her dishevelled locks, the name of the _comet_. The _third_ period\n",
      "expires in the year six hundred and eighteen, a date that exactly agrees\n",
      "with the tremendous comet of the Sibyl, and perhaps of Pliny, which\n",
      "arose in the West two generations before the reign of Cyrus. The\n",
      "_fourth_ apparition, forty-four years before the birth of Christ, is of\n",
      "all others the most splendid and important. After the death of CÊsar, a\n",
      "long-haired star was conspicuous to Rome and to the nations, during the\n",
      "games which were exhibited by young Octavian in honor of Venus and his\n",
      "uncle. The vulgar opinion, that it conveyed to heaven the divine soul of\n",
      "the dictator, was cherished and consecrated by the piety of a statesman;\n",
      "while his secret superstition referred the comet to the glory of his own\n",
      "times. The _fifth_ visit has been already ascribed to the fifth year of\n",
      "Justinian, which coincides with the five hundred and thirty-first of\n",
      "the Christian Êra. And it may deserve notice, that in this, as in the\n",
      "preceding instance, the comet was followed, though at a longer interval,\n",
      "by a remarkable paleness of the sun. The _sixth_ return, in the year\n",
      "eleven hundred and six, is recorded by the chronicles of Europe and\n",
      "China: and in the first fervor of the crusades, the Christians and\n",
      "the Mahometans might surmise, with equal reason, that it portended the\n",
      "destruction of the Infidels. The _seventh_ phenomenon, of one thousand\n",
      "six hundred and eighty, was presented to the eyes of an enlightened age.\n",
      "The philosophy of Bayle dispelled a prejudice which Milton's muse had\n",
      "so recently adorned, that the comet, \"from its horrid hair shakes\n",
      "pestilence and war.\" Its road in the heavens was observed with exquisite\n",
      "skill by Flamstead and Cassini: and the mathematical science of\n",
      "Bernoulli, Newton, and Halley, investigated the laws of its\n",
      "revolutions. At the _eighth_ period, in the year two thousand three\n",
      "hundred and fifty-five, their calculations may perhaps be verified\n",
      "by the astronomers of some future capital in the Siberian or American\n",
      "wilderness.\n",
      "\n",
      "II. The near approach of a comet may injure or destroy the globe which\n",
      "we inhabit; but the changes on its surface have been hitherto produced\n",
      "by the action of volcanoes and earthquakes. The nature of the soil may\n",
      "indicate the countries most exposed to these formidable concussions,\n",
      "since they are caused by subterraneous fires, and such fires are kindled\n",
      "by the union and fermentation of iron and sulphur. But their times\n",
      "and effects appear to lie beyond the reach of human curiosity; and the\n",
      "philosopher will discreetly abstain from the prediction of earthquakes,\n",
      "till he has counted the drops of water that silently filtrate on\n",
      "the inflammable mineral, and measured the caverns which increase by\n",
      "resistance the explosion of the imprisoned air. Without assigning the\n",
      "cause, history will distinguish the periods in which these calamitous\n",
      "events have been rare or frequent, and will observe, that this fever of\n",
      "the earth raged with uncommon violence during the reign of Justinian.\n",
      "Each year is marked by the repetition of earthquakes, of such duration,\n",
      "that Constantinople has been shaken above forty days; of such extent,\n",
      "that the shock has been communicated to the whole surface of the globe,\n",
      "or at least of the Roman empire. An impulsive or vibratory motion was\n",
      "felt: enormous chasms were opened, huge and heavy bodies were discharged\n",
      "into the air, the sea alternately advanced and retreated beyond its\n",
      "ordinary bounds, and a mountain was torn from Libanus, and cast into\n",
      "the waves, where it protected, as a mole, the new harbor of Botrys\n",
      "in Phnicia. The stroke that agitates an ant-hill may crush the\n",
      "insect-myriads in the dust; yet truth must extort confession that man\n",
      "has industriously labored for his own destruction. The institution of\n",
      "great cities, which include a nation within the limits of a wall, almost\n",
      "realizes the wish of Caligula, that the Roman people had but one neck.\n",
      "Two hundred and fifty thousand persons are said to have perished in the\n",
      "earthquake of Antioch, whose domestic multitudes were swelled by the\n",
      "conflux of strangers to the festival of the Ascension. The loss of\n",
      "Berytus was of smaller account, but of much greater value. That city,\n",
      "on the coast of Phnicia, was illustrated by the study of the civil\n",
      "law, which opened the surest road to wealth and dignity: the schools of\n",
      "Berytus were filled with the rising spirits of the age, and many a youth\n",
      "was lost in the earthquake, who might have lived to be the scourge or\n",
      "the guardian of his country. In these disasters, the architect becomes\n",
      "the enemy of mankind. The hut of a savage, or the tent of an Arab, may\n",
      "be thrown down without injury to the inhabitant; and the Peruvians had\n",
      "reason to deride the folly of their Spanish conquerors, who with so\n",
      "much cost and labor erected their own sepulchres. The rich marbles of a\n",
      "patrician are dashed on his own head: a whole people is buried under the\n",
      "ruins of public and private edifices, and the conflagration is kindled\n",
      "and propagated by the innumerable fires which are necessary for the\n",
      "subsistence and manufactures of a great city. Instead of the mutual\n",
      "sympathy which might comfort and assist the distressed, they dreadfully\n",
      "experience the vices and passions which are released from the fear\n",
      "of punishment: the tottering houses are pillaged by intrepid avarice;\n",
      "revenge embraces the moment, and selects the victim; and the earth often\n",
      "swallows the assassin, or the ravisher, in the consummation of their\n",
      "crimes. Superstition involves the present danger with invisible terrors;\n",
      "and if the image of death may sometimes be subservient to the virtue or\n",
      "repentance of individuals, an affrighted people is more forcibly moved\n",
      "to expect the end of the world, or to deprecate with servile homage the\n",
      "wrath of an avenging Deity.\n",
      "\n",
      "III. ∆thiopia and Egypt have been stigmatized, in every age, as the\n",
      "original source and seminary of the plague. In a damp, hot, stagnating\n",
      "air, this African fever is generated from the putrefaction of animal\n",
      "substances, and especially from the swarms of locusts, not less\n",
      "destructive to mankind in their death than in their lives. The fatal\n",
      "disease which depopulated the earth in the time of Justinian and his\n",
      "successors, first appeared in the neighborhood of Pelusium, between the\n",
      "Serbonian bog and the eastern channel of the Nile. From thence, tracing\n",
      "as it were a double path, it spread to the East, over Syria, Persia, and\n",
      "the Indies, and penetrated to the West, along the coast of Africa,\n",
      "and over the continent of Europe. In the spring of the second year,\n",
      "Constantinople, during three or four months, was visited by the\n",
      "pestilence; and Procopius, who observed its progress and symptoms\n",
      "with the eyes of a physician, has emulated the skill and diligence of\n",
      "Thucydides in the description of the plague of Athens. The infection\n",
      "was sometimes announced by the visions of a distempered fancy, and the\n",
      "victim despaired as soon as he had heard the menace and felt the stroke\n",
      "of an invisible spectre. But the greater number, in their beds, in the\n",
      "streets, in their usual occupation, were surprised by a slight fever; so\n",
      "slight, indeed, that neither the pulse nor the color of the patient\n",
      "gave any signs of the approaching danger. The same, the next, or\n",
      "the succeeding day, it was declared by the swelling of the glands,\n",
      "particularly those of the groin, of the armpits, and under the ear; and\n",
      "when these buboes or tumors were opened, they were found to contain a\n",
      "_coal_, or black substance, of the size of a lentil. If they came to a\n",
      "just swelling and suppuration, the patient was saved by this kind and\n",
      "natural discharge of the morbid humor. But if they continued hard and\n",
      "dry, a mortification quickly ensued, and the fifth day was commonly\n",
      "the term of his life. The fever was often accompanied with lethargy or\n",
      "delirium; the bodies of the sick were covered with black pustules or\n",
      "carbuncles, the symptoms of immediate death; and in the constitutions\n",
      "too feeble to produce an irruption, the vomiting of blood was followed\n",
      "by a mortification of the bowels. To pregnant women the plague was\n",
      "generally mortal: yet one infant was drawn alive from his dead mother,\n",
      "and three mothers survived the loss of their infected ftus. Youth was\n",
      "the most perilous season; and the female sex was less susceptible than\n",
      "the male: but every rank and profession was attacked with indiscriminate\n",
      "rage, and many of those who escaped were deprived of the use of\n",
      "their speech, without being secure from a return of the disorder. The\n",
      "physicians of Constantinople were zealous and skilful; but their art\n",
      "was baffled by the various symptoms and pertinacious vehemence of the\n",
      "disease: the same remedies were productive of contrary effects, and the\n",
      "event capriciously disappointed their prognostics of death or recovery.\n",
      "The order of funerals, and the right of sepulchres, were confounded:\n",
      "those who were left without friends or servants, lay unburied in the\n",
      "streets, or in their desolate houses; and a magistrate was authorized to\n",
      "collect the promiscuous heaps of dead bodies, to transport them by land\n",
      "or water, and to inter them in deep pits beyond the precincts of the\n",
      "city. Their own danger, and the prospect of public distress, awakened\n",
      "some remorse in the minds of the most vicious of mankind: the confidence\n",
      "of health again revived their passions and habits; but philosophy must\n",
      "disdain the observation of Procopius, that the lives of such men were\n",
      "guarded by the peculiar favor of fortune or Providence. He forgot, or\n",
      "perhaps he secretly recollected, that the plague had touched the\n",
      "person of Justinian himself; but the abstemious diet of the emperor may\n",
      "suggest, as in the case of Socrates, a more rational and honorable cause\n",
      "for his recovery. During his sickness, the public consternation\n",
      "was expressed in the habits of the citizens; and their idleness and\n",
      "despondence occasioned a general scarcity in the capital of the East.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contagion is the inseparable symptom of the plague; which, by mutual\n",
      "respiration, is transfused from the infected persons to the lungs and\n",
      "stomach of those who approach them. While philosophers believe and\n",
      "tremble, it is singular, that the existence of a real danger should have\n",
      "been denied by a people most prone to vain and imaginary terrors. Yet\n",
      "the fellow-citizens of Procopius were satisfied, by some short and\n",
      "partial experience, that the infection could not be gained by the\n",

      "for years in a bale of cotton was imported, by the abuse of trade, into\n",
      "the most distant regions. The mode of its propagation is explained\n",
      "by the remark of Procopius himself, that it always spread from the\n",
      "sea-coast to the inland country: the most sequestered islands and\n",
      "mountains were successively visited; the places which had escaped the\n",
      "fury of its first passage were alone exposed to the contagion of the\n",

      "atmosphere be previously disposed for its reception, the plague would\n",
      "soon expire in the cold or temperate climates of the earth. Such was the\n",
      "universal corruption of the air, that the pestilence which burst forth\n",
      "in the fifteenth year of Justinian was not checked or alleviated by any\n",
      "difference of the seasons. In time, its first malignity was abated and\n",
      "dispersed; the disease alternately languished and revived; but it was\n",
      "not till the end of a calamitous period of fifty-two years, that mankind\n",
      "recovered their health, or the air resumed its pure and salubrious\n",
      "quality. No facts have been preserved to sustain an account, or even\n",
      "a conjecture, of the numbers that perished in this extraordinary\n",
      "mortality. I only find, that during three months, five, and at length\n",
      "ten, thousand persons died each day at Constantinople; that many cities\n",
      "of the East were left vacant, and that in several districts of Italy the\n",

      "authority of parents, which may seem to draw their origin from _nature_\n",
      "itself, are ascribed to the untutored wisdom of Romulus. The law of\n",
      "_nations_ and of religious worship, which Numa introduced, was derived\n",
      "from his nocturnal converse with the nymph Egeria. The _civil_ law is\n",
      "attributed to the experience of Servius: he balanced the rights and\n",

      "was adapted to the state of the city; and the Romans had emerged\n",
      "from Barbarism, since they were capable of studying and embracing the\n",
      "institutions of their more enlightened neighbors. A wise Ephesian was\n",
      "driven by envy from his native country: before he could reach the shores\n",

      "relieved the wants of a people whose agriculture was often interrupted\n",
      "by war and faction; and since the trade was established, the deputies\n",
      "who sailed from the Tyber might return from the same harbors with a more\n",
      "precious cargo of political wisdom. The colonies of Great Greece had\n",
      "transported and improved the arts of their mother country. CumÊ and\n",
      "Rhegium, Crotona and Tarentum, Agrigentum and Syracuse, were in the\n",
      "rank of the most flourishing cities. The disciples of Pythagoras applied\n",
      "philosophy to the use of government; the unwritten laws of Charondas\n",
      "accepted the aid of poetry and music, and Zaleucus framed the republic\n",
      "of the Locrians, which stood without alteration above two hundred years.\n",
      "From a similar motive of national pride, both Livy and Dionysius are\n",
      "willing to believe, that the deputies of Rome visited Athens under the\n",

      "familiar to the Greeks before the reign of Alexander; and the faintest\n",

      "succeeding times. But the Athenian monuments are silent; nor will it\n",

      "navigation to copy the purest model of democracy. In the comparison of\n",
      "the tables of Solon with those of the Decemvirs, some casual resemblance\n",
      "may be found; some rules which nature and reason have revealed to every\n",

      "the lawyers of every country delight to bestow on their municipal\n",
      "institutions. The study is recommended by Cicero as equally pleasant and\n",

      "to the memory of the young and the meditation of the old; they were\n",
      "transcribed and illustrated with learned diligence; they had escaped the\n",
      "flames of the Gauls, they subsisted in the age of Justinian, and their\n",
      "subsequent loss has been imperfectly restored by the labors of modern\n",
      "critics. But although these venerable monuments were considered as the\n",
      "rule of right and the fountain of justice, they were overwhelmed by the\n",
      "weight and variety of new laws, which, at the end of five centuries,\n",
      "became a grievance more intolerable than the vices of the city. Three\n",
      "thousand brass plates, the acts of the senate of the people, were\n",
      "deposited in the Capitol: and some of the acts, as the Julian law\n",
      "against extortion, surpassed the number of a hundred chapters. The\n",
      "Decemvirs had neglected to import the sanction of Zaleucus, which so\n",
      "long maintained the integrity of his republic. A Locrian, who proposed\n",
      "any new law, stood forth in the assembly of the people with a cord\n",
      "round his neck, and if the law was rejected, the innovator was instantly\n",
      "strangled.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Decemvirs had been named, and their tables were approved, by an\n",
      "assembly of the _centuries_, in which riches preponderated against\n",
      "numbers. To the first class of Romans, the proprietors of one hundred\n",
      "thousand pounds of copper, ninety-eight votes were assigned, and\n",
      "only ninety-five were left for the six inferior classes, distributed\n",
      "according to their substance by the artful policy of Servius. But the\n",
      "tribunes soon established a more specious and popular maxim, that every\n",
      "citizen has an equal right to enact the laws which he is bound to\n",
      "obey. Instead of the _centuries_, they convened the _tribes_; and the\n",
      "patricians, after an impotent struggle, submitted to the decrees of an\n",
      "assembly, in which their votes were confounded with those of the meanest\n",
      "plebeians. Yet as long as the tribes successively passed over narrow\n",
      "_bridges_ and gave their voices aloud, the conduct of each citizen\n",
      "was exposed to the eyes and ears of his friends and countrymen. The\n",
      "insolvent debtor consulted the wishes of his creditor; the client would\n",
      "have blushed to oppose the views of his patron; the general was followed\n",
      "by his veterans, and the aspect of a grave magistrate was a living\n",
      "lesson to the multitude. A new method of secret ballot abolished the\n",
      "influence of fear and shame, of honor and interest, and the abuse of\n",
      "freedom accelerated the progress of anarchy and despotism. The\n",
      "Romans had aspired to be equal; they were levelled by the equality of\n",
      "servitude; and the dictates of Augustus were patiently ratified by\n",
      "the formal consent of the tribes or centuries. Once, and once only,\n",
      "he experienced a sincere and strenuous opposition. His subjects had\n",
      "resigned all political liberty; they defended the freedom of domestic\n",
      "life. A law which enforced the obligation, and strengthened the bonds\n",
      "of marriage, was clamorously rejected; Propertius, in the arms of Delia,\n",
      "applauded the victory of licentious love; and the project of reform was\n",
      "suspended till a new and more tractable generation had arisen in the\n",
      "world. Such an example was not necessary to instruct a prudent usurper\n",
      "of the mischief of popular assemblies; and their abolition, which\n",
      "Augustus had silently prepared, was accomplished without resistance, and\n",
      "almost without notice, on the accession of his successor. Sixty thousand\n",
      "plebeian legislators, whom numbers made formidable, and poverty secure,\n",
      "were supplanted by six hundred senators, who held their honors, their\n",
      "fortunes, and their lives, by the clemency of the emperor. The loss of\n",
      "executive power was alleviated by the gift of legislative authority; and\n",
      "Ulpian might assert, after the practice of two hundred years, that the\n",
      "decrees of the senate obtained the force and validity of laws. In the\n",
      "times of freedom, the resolves of the people had often been dictated by\n",
      "the passion or error of the moment: the Cornelian, Pompeian, and Julian\n",
      "laws were adapted by a single hand to the prevailing disorders; but the\n",
      "senate, under the reign of the CÊsars, was composed of magistrates and\n",
      "lawyers, and in questions of private jurisprudence, the integrity of\n",
      "their judgment was seldom perverted by fear or interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The silence or ambiguity of the laws was supplied by the occasional\n",
      "edicts of those magistrates who were invested with the _honors_ of the\n",
      "state. This ancient prerogative of the Roman kings was transferred, in\n",
      "their respective offices, to the consuls and dictators, the censors and\n",
      "prÊtors; and a similar right was assumed by the tribunes of the people,\n",
      "the ediles, and the proconsuls. At Rome, and in the provinces, the\n",
      "duties of the subject, and the intentions of the governor, were\n",
      "proclaimed; and the civil jurisprudence was reformed by the annual\n",
      "edicts of the supreme judge, the prÊtor of the city. As soon as he\n",
      "ascended his tribunal, he announced by the voice of the crier, and\n",
      "afterwards inscribed on a white wall, the rules which he proposed to\n",
      "follow in the decision of doubtful cases, and the relief which his\n",
      "equity would afford from the precise rigor of ancient statutes. A\n",
      "principle of discretion more congenial to monarchy was introduced into\n",
      "the republic: the art of respecting the name, and eluding the efficacy,\n",
      "of the laws, was improved by successive prÊtors; subtleties and fictions\n",
      "were invented to defeat the plainest meaning of the Decemvirs, and where\n",
      "the end was salutary, the means were frequently absurd. The secret or\n",
      "probable wish of the dead was suffered to prevail over the order of\n",
      "succession and the forms of testaments; and the claimant, who was\n",
      "excluded from the character of heir, accepted with equal pleasure from\n",
      "an indulgent prÊtor the possession of the goods of his late kinsman or\n",
      "benefactor. In the redress of private wrongs, compensations and fines\n",
      "were substituted to the obsolete rigor of the Twelve Tables; time and\n",
      "space were annihilated by fanciful suppositions; and the plea of\n",
      "youth, or fraud, or violence, annulled the obligation, or excused the\n",
      "performance, of an inconvenient contract. A jurisdiction thus vague and\n",
      "arbitrary was exposed to the most dangerous abuse: the substance, as\n",
      "well as the form, of justice were often sacrificed to the prejudices of\n",
      "virtue, the bias of laudable affection, and the grosser seductions of\n",
      "interest or resentment. But the errors or vices of each prÊtor expired\n",
      "with his annual office; such maxims alone as had been approved by reason\n",
      "and practice were copied by succeeding judges; the rule of proceeding\n",
      "was defined by the solution of new cases; and the temptations of\n",
      "injustice were removed by the Cornelian law, which compelled the\n",
      "prÊtor of the year to adhere to the spirit and letter of his first\n",
      "proclamation. It was reserved for the curiosity and learning of Adrian,\n",
      "to accomplish the design which had been conceived by the genius of\n",
      "CÊsar; and the prÊtorship of Salvius Julian, an eminent lawyer,\n",
      "was immortalized by the composition of the Perpetual Edict. This\n",
      "well-digested code was ratified by the emperor and the senate; the long\n",
      "divorce of law and equity was at length reconciled; and, instead of the\n",
      "Twelve Tables, the perpetual edict was fixed as the invariable standard\n",
      "of civil jurisprudence.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Augustus to Trajan, the modest CÊsars were content to promulgate\n",
      "their edicts in the various characters of a Roman magistrate; and, in\n",
      "the decrees of the senate, the _epistles_ and _orations_ of the prince\n",
      "were respectfully inserted. Adrian appears to have been the first who\n",
      "assumed, without disguise, the plenitude of legislative power. And this\n",
      "innovation, so agreeable to his active mind, was countenanced by the\n",
      "patience of the times, and his long absence from the seat of government.\n",
      "The same policy was embraced by succeeding monarchs, and, according to\n",
      "the harsh metaphor of Tertullian, \"the gloomy and intricate forest\n",
      "of ancient laws was cleared away by the axe of royal mandates and\n",
      "_constitutions_.\" During four centuries, from Adrian to Justinian\n",
      "the public and private jurisprudence was moulded by the will of the\n",
      "sovereign; and few institutions, either human or divine, were permitted\n",
      "to stand on their former basis. The origin of Imperial legislation was\n",
      "concealed by the darkness of ages and the terrors of armed despotism;\n",
      "and a double fiction was propagated by the servility, or perhaps the\n",
      "ignorance, of the civilians, who basked in the sunshine of the Roman and\n",
      "Byzantine courts. 1. To the prayer of the ancient CÊsars, the people\n",
      "or the senate had sometimes granted a personal exemption from the\n",
      "obligation and penalty of particular statutes; and each indulgence was\n",
      "an act of jurisdiction exercised by the republic over the first of\n",
      "her citizens. His humble privilege was at length transformed into the\n",
      "prerogative of a tyrant; and the Latin expression of \"released from the\n",
      "laws\" was supposed to exalt the emperor above _all_ human restraints,\n",
      "and to leave his conscience and reason as the sacred measure of his\n",
      "conduct. 2. A similar dependence was implied in the decrees of the\n",
      "senate, which, in every reign, defined the titles and powers of an\n",
      "elective magistrate. But it was not before the ideas, and even the\n",
      "language, of the Romans had been corrupted, that a _royal_ law, and an\n",
      "irrevocable gift of the people, were created by the fancy of Ulpian, or\n",
      "more probably of Tribonian himself; and the origin of Imperial power,\n",
      "though false in fact, and slavish in its consequence, was supported on\n",
      "a principle of freedom and justice. \"The pleasure of the emperor has the\n",
      "vigor and effect of law, since the Roman people, by the royal law,\n",
      "have transferred to their prince the full extent of their own power and\n",
      "sovereignty.\" The will of a single man, of a child perhaps, was allowed\n",
      "to prevail over the wisdom of ages and the inclinations of millions; and\n",
      "the degenerate Greeks were proud to declare, that in his hands alone\n",
      "the arbitrary exercise of legislation could be safely deposited. \"What\n",
      "interest or passion,\" exclaims Theophilus in the court of Justinian,\n",
      "\"can reach the calm and sublime elevation of the monarch? He is already\n",
      "master of the lives and fortunes of his subjects; and those who have\n",
      "incurred his displeasure are already numbered with the dead.\" Disdaining\n",
      "the language of flattery, the historian may confess, that in questions\n",
      "of private jurisprudence, the absolute sovereign of a great empire can\n",
      "seldom be influenced by any personal considerations. Virtue, or even\n",
      "reason, will suggest to his impartial mind, that he is the guardian\n",
      "of peace and equity, and that the interest of society is inseparably\n",
      "connected with his own. Under the weakest and most vicious reign, the\n",
      "seat of justice was filled by the wisdom and integrity of Papinian and\n",
      "Ulpian; and the purest materials of the Code and Pandects are inscribed\n",
      "with the names of Caracalla and his ministers. The tyrant of Rome was\n",
      "sometimes the benefactor of the provinces. A dagger terminated the\n",
      "crimes of Domitian; but the prudence of Nerva confirmed his acts, which,\n",
      "in the joy of their deliverance, had been rescinded by an indignant\n",
      "senate. Yet in the _rescripts_, replies to the consultations of the\n",
      "magistrates, the wisest of princes might be deceived by a partial\n",
      "exposition of the case. And this abuse, which placed their hasty\n",
      "decisions on the same level with mature and deliberate acts of\n",
      "legislation, was ineffectually condemned by the sense and example of\n",
      "Trajan. The _rescripts_ of the emperor, his _grants_ and _decrees_, his\n",
      "_edicts_ and _pragmatic sanctions_, were subscribed in purple ink,\n",
      "and transmitted to the provinces as general or special laws, which the\n",

      "and patricians. Like the Chaldean astrologers, they announced to their\n",
      "clients the days of business and repose; these important trifles were\n",
      "interwoven with the religion of Numa; and after the publication of the\n",

      "The second period, the learned and splendid age of jurisprudence, may be\n",
      "extended from the birth of Cicero to the reign of Severus Alexander.\n",
      "A system was formed, schools were instituted, books were composed, and\n",

      "under the CÊsars, is finally closed by the respectable characters of\n",
      "Papinian, of Paul, and of Ulpian. Their names, and the various titles\n",
      "of their productions, have been minutely preserved, and the example\n",
      "of Labeo may suggest some idea of their diligence and fecundity. That\n",
      "eminent lawyer of the Augustan age divided the year between the city and\n",
      "country, between business and composition; and four hundred books are\n",
      "enumerated as the fruit of his retirement. Of the collection of his\n",
      "rival Capito, the two hundred and fifty-ninth book is expressly quoted;\n",
      "and few teachers could deliver their opinions in less than a century\n",
      "of volumes. In the third period, between the reigns of Alexander and\n",
      "Justinian, the oracles of jurisprudence were almost mute. The measure\n",
      "of curiosity had been filled: the throne was occupied by tyrants and\n",
      "Barbarians, the active spirits were diverted by religious disputes, and\n",
      "the professors of Rome, Constantinople, and Berytus, were humbly content\n",

      "inferred, that they require a state of peace and refinement. From the\n",
      "multitude of voluminous civilians who fill the intermediate space, it\n",
      "is evident that such studies may be pursued, and such works may be\n",
      "performed, with a common share of judgment, experience, and industry.\n",
      "The genius of Cicero and Virgil was more sensibly felt, as each\n",
      "revolving age had been found incapable of producing a similar or a\n",

      "The jurisprudence which had been grossly adapted to the wants of the\n",

      "taught by use and experience; but Servius Sulpicius was the first\n",
      "civilian who established his art on a certain and general theory. For\n",
      "the discernment of truth and falsehood he applied, as an infallible\n",
      "rule, the logic of Aristotle and the stoics, reduced particular cases\n",
      "to general principles, and diffused over the shapeless mass the light of\n",
      "order and eloquence. Cicero, his contemporary and friend, declined the\n",
      "reputation of a professed lawyer; but the jurisprudence of his country\n",
      "was adorned by his incomparable genius, which converts into gold every\n",
      "object that it touches. After the example of Plato, he composed a\n",
      "republic; and, for the use of his republic, a treatise of laws; in which\n",
      "he labors to deduce from a celestial origin the wisdom and justice of\n",
      "the Roman constitution. The whole universe, according to his sublime\n",
      "hypothesis, forms one immense commonwealth: gods and men, who\n",
      "participate of the same essence, are members of the same community;\n",
      "reason prescribes the law of nature and nations; and all positive\n",
      "institutions, however modified by accident or custom, are drawn from\n",
      "the rule of right, which the Deity has inscribed on every virtuous mind.\n",
      "From these philosophical mysteries, he mildly excludes the sceptics\n",
      "who refuse to believe, and the epicureans who are unwilling to act. The\n",
      "latter disdain the care of the republic: he advises them to slumber in\n",
      "their shady gardens. But he humbly entreats that the new academy would\n",
      "be silent, since her bold objections would too soon destroy the fair and\n",
      "well ordered structure of his lofty system. Plato, Aristotle, and Zeno,\n",
      "he represents as the only teachers who arm and instruct a citizen for\n",
      "the duties of social life. Of these, the armor of the stoics was found\n",
      "to be of the firmest temper; and it was chiefly worn, both for use and\n",
      "ornament, in the schools of jurisprudence. From the portico, the Roman\n",
      "civilians learned to live, to reason, and to die: but they imbibed\n",
      "in some degree the prejudices of the sect; the love of paradox, the\n",
      "pertinacious habits of dispute, and a minute attachment to words\n",
      "and verbal distinctions. The superiority of _form_ to _matter_ was\n",
      "introduced to ascertain the right of property: and the equality of\n",
      "crimes is countenanced by an opinion of Trebatius, that he who touches\n",
      "the ear, touches the whole body; and that he who steals from a heap of\n",
      "corn, or a hogshead of wine, is guilty of the entire theft.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arms, eloquence, and the study of the civil law, promoted a citizen to\n",
      "the honors of the Roman state; and the three professions were\n",
      "sometimes more conspicuous by their union in the same character. In\n",
      "the composition of the edict, a learned prÊtor gave a sanction and\n",
      "preference to his private sentiments; the opinion of a censor, or a\n",
      "counsel, was entertained with respect; and a doubtful interpretation of\n",
      "the laws might be supported by the virtues or triumphs of the civilian.\n",
      "The patrician arts were long protected by the veil of mystery; and in\n",
      "more enlightened times, the freedom of inquiry established the general\n",
      "principles of jurisprudence. Subtile and intricate cases were elucidated\n",
      "by the disputes of the forum: rules, axioms, and definitions, were\n",
      "admitted as the genuine dictates of reason; and the consent of the legal\n",
      "professors was interwoven into the practice of the tribunals. But these\n",
      "interpreters could neither enact nor execute the laws of the republic;\n",
      "and the judges might disregard the authority of the ScÊvolas themselves,\n",
      "which was often overthrown by the eloquence or sophistry of an ingenious\n",
      "pleader. Augustus and Tiberius were the first to adopt, as a useful\n",
      "engine, the science of the civilians; and their servile labors\n",
      "accommodated the old system to the spirit and views of despotism. Under\n",
      "the fair pretence of securing the dignity of the art, the privilege\n",
      "of subscribing legal and valid opinions was confined to the sages of\n",
      "senatorian or equestrian rank, who had been previously approved by\n",
      "the judgment of the prince; and this monopoly prevailed, till Adrian\n",
      "restored the freedom of the profession to every citizen conscious of his\n",
      "abilities and knowledge. The discretion of the prÊtor was now governed\n",
      "by the lessons of his teachers; the judges were enjoined to obey the\n",
      "comment as well as the text of the law; and the use of codicils was\n",
      "a memorable innovation, which Augustus ratified by the advice of the\n",
      "civilians.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most absolute mandate could only require that the judges should\n",
      "agree with the civilians, if the civilians agreed among themselves. But\n",
      "positive institutions are often the result of custom and prejudice; laws\n",
      "and language are ambiguous and arbitrary; where reason is incapable of\n",
      "pronouncing, the love of argument is inflamed by the envy of rivals,\n",
      "the vanity of masters, the blind attachment of their disciples; and\n",
      "the Roman jurisprudence was divided by the once famous sects of the\n",
      "_Proculians_ and _Sabinians_. Two sages of the law, Ateius Capito and\n",
      "Antistius Labeo, adorned the peace of the Augustan age; the former\n",
      "distinguished by the favor of his sovereign; the latter more illustrious\n",
      "by his contempt of that favor, and his stern though harmless opposition\n",
      "to the tyrant of Rome. Their legal studies were influenced by the\n",
      "various colors of their temper and principles. Labeo was attached to\n",
      "the form of the old republic; his rival embraced the more profitable\n",
      "substance of the rising monarchy. But the disposition of a courtier\n",
      "is tame and submissive; and Capito seldom presumed to deviate from the\n",
      "sentiments, or at least from the words, of his predecessors; while the\n",
      "bold republican pursued his independent ideas without fear of paradox or\n",
      "innovations. The freedom of Labeo was enslaved, however, by the rigor of\n",
      "his own conclusions, and he decided, according to the letter of the\n",
      "law, the same questions which his indulgent competitor resolved with\n",
      "a latitude of equity more suitable to the common sense and feelings\n",
      "of mankind. If a fair exchange had been substituted to the payment of\n",
      "money, Capito still considered the transaction as a legal sale; and\n",
      "he consulted nature for the age of puberty, without confining his\n",
      "definition to the precise period of twelve or fourteen years. This\n",
      "opposition of sentiments was propagated in the writings and lessons\n",
      "of the two founders; the schools of Capito and Labeo maintained their\n",
      "inveterate conflict from the age of Augustus to that of Adrian; and the\n",
      "two sects derived their appellations from Sabinus and Proculus, their\n",
      "most celebrated teachers. The names of _Cassians_ and _Pegasians_ were\n",
      "likewise applied to the same parties; but, by a strange reverse, the\n",
      "popular cause was in the hands of Pegasus, a timid slave of Domitian,\n",
      "while the favorite of the CÊsars was represented by Cassius, who gloried\n",
      "in his descent from the patriot assassin. By the perpetual edict, the\n",
      "controversies of the sects were in a great measure determined. For that\n",
      "important work, the emperor Adrian preferred the chief of the Sabinians:\n",
      "the friends of monarchy prevailed; but the moderation of Salvius\n",
      "Julian insensibly reconciled the victors and the vanquished. Like the\n",
      "contemporary philosophers, the lawyers of the age of the Antonines\n",
      "disclaimed the authority of a master, and adopted from every system\n",
      "the most probable doctrines. But their writings would have been less\n",
      "voluminous, had their choice been more unanimous. The conscience of the\n",
      "judge was perplexed by the number and weight of discordant testimonies,\n",
      "and every sentence that his passion or interest might pronounce was\n",
      "justified by the sanction of some venerable name. An indulgent edict\n",
      "of the younger Theodosius excused him from the labor of comparing and\n",
      "weighing their arguments. Five civilians, Caius, Papinian, Paul, Ulpian,\n",
      "and Modestinus, were established as the oracles of jurisprudence: a\n",
      "majority was decisive: but if their opinions were equally divided, a\n",
      "casting vote was ascribed to the superior wisdom of Papinian.\n",

      "\n",
      "When Justinian ascended the throne, the reformation of the Roman\n",
      "jurisprudence was an arduous but indispensable task. In the space of ten\n",
      "centuries, the infinite variety of laws and legal opinions had filled\n",
      "many thousand volumes, which no fortune could purchase and no capacity\n",
      "could digest. Books could not easily be found; and the judges, poor in\n",
      "the midst of riches, were reduced to the exercise of their illiterate\n",
      "discretion. The subjects of the Greek provinces were ignorant of\n",
      "the language that disposed of their lives and properties; and the\n",
      "_barbarous_ dialect of the Latins was imperfectly studied in the\n",
      "academies of Berytus and Constantinople. As an Illyrian soldier, that\n",
      "idiom was familiar to the infancy of Justinian; his youth had been\n",
      "instructed by the lessons of jurisprudence, and his Imperial choice\n",
      "selected the most learned civilians of the East, to labor with their\n",
      "sovereign in the work of reformation. The theory of professors\n",
      "was assisted by the practice of advocates, and the experience of\n",
      "magistrates; and the whole undertaking was animated by the spirit of\n",
      "Tribonian. This extraordinary man, the object of so much praise and\n",
      "censure, was a native of Side in Pamphylia; and his genius, like that of\n",
      "Bacon, embraced, as his own, all the business and knowledge of the age.\n",
      "Tribonian composed, both in prose and verse, on a strange diversity of\n",
      "curious and abstruse subjects: a double panegyric of Justinian and\n",
      "the life of the philosopher Theodotus; the nature of happiness and the\n",
      "duties of government; Homer's catalogue and the four-and-twenty sorts of\n",
      "metre; the astronomical canon of Ptolemy; the changes of the months;\n",
      "the houses of the planets; and the harmonic system of the world. To the\n",
      "literature of Greece he added the use of the Latin tongue; the Roman\n",
      "civilians were deposited in his library and in his mind; and he most\n",
      "assiduously cultivated those arts which opened the road of wealth and\n",
      "preferment. From the bar of the PrÊtorian prÊfects, he raised himself\n",
      "to the honors of quÊstor, of consul, and of master of the offices: the\n",
      "council of Justinian listened to his eloquence and wisdom; and envy\n",
      "was mitigated by the gentleness and affability of his manners. The\n",
      "reproaches of impiety and avarice have stained the virtue or the\n",
      "reputation of Tribonian. In a bigoted and persecuting court, the\n",
      "principal minister was accused of a secret aversion to the Christian\n",
      "faith, and was supposed to entertain the sentiments of an Atheist and\n",
      "a Pagan, which have been imputed, inconsistently enough, to the last\n",
      "philosophers of Greece. His avarice was more clearly proved and more\n",
      "sensibly felt. If he were swayed by gifts in the administration of\n",
      "justice, the example of Bacon will again occur; nor can the merit of\n",
      "Tribonian atone for his baseness, if he degraded the sanctity of his\n",
      "profession; and if laws were every day enacted, modified, or repealed,\n",
      "for the base consideration of his private emolument. In the sedition of\n",
      "Constantinople, his removal was granted to the clamors, perhaps to the\n",
      "just indignation, of the people: but the quÊstor was speedily restored,\n",
      "and, till the hour of his death, he possessed, above twenty years, the\n",
      "favor and confidence of the emperor. His passive and dutiful submission\n",
      "had been honored with the praise of Justinian himself, whose vanity was\n",
      "incapable of discerning how often that submission degenerated into the\n",
      "grossest adulation. Tribonian adored the virtues of his gracious of\n",
      "his gracious master; the earth was unworthy of such a prince; and he\n",
      "affected a pious fear, that Justinian, like Elijah or Romulus, would be\n",
      "snatched into the air, and translated alive to the mansions of celestial\n",
      "glory.\n",
      "\n",
      "If CÊsar had achieved the reformation of the Roman law, his creative\n",
      "genius, enlightened by reflection and study, would have given to the\n",
      "world a pure and original system of jurisprudence. Whatever flattery\n",
      "might suggest, the emperor of the East was afraid to establish his\n",
      "private judgment as the standard of equity: in the possession of\n",
      "legislative power, he borrowed the aid of time and opinion; and his\n",
      "laborious compilations are guarded by the sages and legislature of past\n",
      "times. Instead of a statue cast in a simple mould by the hand of an\n",
      "artist, the works of Justinian represent a tessellated pavement of\n",
      "antique and costly, but too often of incoherent, fragments. In the first\n",
      "year of his reign, he directed the faithful Tribonian, and nine learned\n",
      "associates, to revise the ordinances of his predecessors, as they were\n",
      "contained, since the time of Adrian, in the Gregorian Hermogenian, and\n",
      "Theodosian codes; to purge the errors and contradictions, to retrench\n",
      "whatever was obsolete or superfluous, and to select the wise and\n",
      "salutary laws best adapted to the practice of the tribunals and the use\n",
      "of his subjects. The work was accomplished in fourteen months; and the\n",
      "twelve books or _tables_, which the new decemvirs produced, might be\n",
      "designed to imitate the labors of their Roman predecessors. The new\n",

      "and scribes; they were transmitted to the magistrates of the European,\n",
      "the Asiatic, and afterwards the African provinces; and the law of the\n",
      "empire was proclaimed on solemn festivals at the doors of churches.\n",
      "A more arduous operation was still behind--to extract the spirit of\n",
      "jurisprudence from the decisions and conjectures, the questions and\n",
      "disputes, of the Roman civilians. Seventeen lawyers, with Tribonian\n",
      "at their head, were appointed by the emperor to exercise an absolute\n",
      "jurisdiction over the works of their predecessors. If they had obeyed\n",
      "his commands in ten years, Justinian would have been satisfied with\n",
      "their diligence; and the rapid composition of the Digest or Pandects, in\n",
      "three years, will deserve praise or censure, according to the merit of\n",
      "the execution. From the library of Tribonian, they chose forty, the most\n",
      "eminent civilians of former times: two thousand treatises were comprised\n",
      "in an abridgment of fifty books; and it has been carefully recorded,\n",
      "that three millions of lines or sentences, were reduced, in this\n",
      "abstract, to the moderate number of one hundred and fifty thousand.\n",
      "The edition of this great work was delayed a month after that of the\n",
      "Institutes; and it seemed reasonable that the elements should precede\n",
      "the digest of the Roman law. As soon as the emperor had approved their\n",
      "labors, he ratified, by his legislative power, the speculations of\n",
      "these private citizens: their commentaries, on the twelve tables, the\n",
      "perpetual edict, the laws of the people, and the decrees of the senate,\n",
      "succeeded to the authority of the text; and the text was abandoned, as\n",
      "a useless, though venerable, relic of antiquity. The _Code_, the\n",
      "_Pandects_, and the _Institutes_, were declared to be the legitimate\n",
      "system of civil jurisprudence; they alone were admitted into the\n",
      "tribunals, and they alone were taught in the academies of Rome,\n",
      "Constantinople, and Berytus. Justinian addressed to the senate and\n",
      "provinces his _eternal oracles_; and his pride, under the mask of\n",
      "piety, ascribed the consummation of this great design to the support and\n",
      "inspiration of the Deity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the emperor declined the fame and envy of original composition, we\n",
      "can only require, at his hands, method choice, and fidelity, the\n",
      "humble, though indispensable, virtues of a compiler. Among the various\n",
      "combinations of ideas, it is difficult to assign any reasonable\n",
      "preference; but as the order of Justinian is different in his three\n",
      "works, it is possible that all may be wrong; and it is certain that\n",
      "two cannot be right. In the selection of ancient laws, he seems to have\n",
      "viewed his predecessors without jealousy, and with equal regard: the\n",
      "series could not ascend above the reign of Adrian, and the narrow\n",
      "distinction of Paganism and Christianity, introduced by the superstition\n",
      "of Theodosius, had been abolished by the consent of mankind. But the\n",
      "jurisprudence of the Pandects is circumscribed within a period of\n",
      "a hundred years, from the perpetual edict to the death of Severus\n",
      "Alexander: the civilians who lived under the first CÊsars are seldom\n",
      "permitted to speak, and only three names can be attributed to the age of\n",
      "the republic. The favorite of Justinian (it has been fiercely urged) was\n",
      "fearful of encountering the light of freedom and the gravity of Roman\n",
      "sages. Tribonian condemned to oblivion the genuine and native wisdom\n",
      "of Cato, the ScÊvolas, and Sulpicius; while he invoked spirits more\n",
      "congenial to his own, the Syrians, Greeks, and Africans, who flocked to\n",
      "the Imperial court to study Latin as a foreign tongue, and jurisprudence\n",
      "as a lucrative profession. But the ministers of Justinian, were\n",
      "instructed to labor, not for the curiosity of antiquarians, but for\n",
      "the immediate benefit of his subjects. It was their duty to select the\n",
      "useful and practical parts of the Roman law; and the writings of the old\n",
      "republicans, however curious on excellent, were no longer suited to\n",
      "the new system of manners, religion, and government. Perhaps, if the\n",
      "preceptors and friends of Cicero were still alive, our candor would\n",
      "acknowledge, that, except in purity of language, their intrinsic merit\n",
      "was excelled by the school of Papinian and Ulpian. The science of the\n",
      "laws is the slow growth of time and experience, and the advantage\n",
      "both of method and materials, is naturally assumed by the most recent\n",
      "authors. The civilians of the reign of the Antonines had studied the\n",
      "works of their predecessors: their philosophic spirit had mitigated the\n",
      "rigor of antiquity, simplified the forms of proceeding, and emerged\n",
      "from the jealousy and prejudice of the rival sects. The choice of\n",
      "the authorities that compose the Pandects depended on the judgment of\n",
      "Tribonian: but the power of his sovereign could not absolve him from\n",
      "the sacred obligations of truth and fidelity. As the legislator of the\n",
      "empire, Justinian might repeal the acts of the Antonines, or condemn, as\n",
      "seditious, the free principles, which were maintained by the last of the\n",
      "_Roman_ lawyers. But the existence of past facts is placed beyond the\n",
      "reach of despotism; and the emperor was guilty of fraud and forgery,\n",
      "when he corrupted the integrity of their text, inscribed with\n",
      "their venerable names the words and ideas of his servile reign, and\n",
      "suppressed, by the hand of power, the pure and authentic copies of\n",
      "their sentiments. The changes and interpolations of Tribonian and his\n",
      "colleagues are excused by the pretence of uniformity: but their cares\n",
      "have been insufficient, and the _antinomies_, or contradictions of the\n",
      "Code and Pandects, still exercise the patience and subtilty of modern\n",
      "civilians.\n",
      "\n",
      "A rumor devoid of evidence has been propagated by the enemies of\n",
      "Justinian; that the jurisprudence of ancient Rome was reduced to ashes\n",
      "by the author of the Pandects, from the vain persuasion, that it was now\n",
      "either false or superfluous. Without usurping an office so\n",
      "invidious, the emperor might safely commit to ignorance and time the\n",
      "accomplishments of this destructive wish. Before the invention of\n",
      "printing and paper, the labor and the materials of writing could be\n",
      "purchased only by the rich; and it may reasonably be computed, that\n",
      "the price of books was a hundred fold their present value. Copies were\n",
      "slowly multiplied and cautiously renewed: the hopes of profit tempted\n",
      "the sacrilegious scribes to erase the characters of antiquity, and\n",
      "Sophocles or Tacitus were obliged to resign the parchment to missals,\n",
      "homilies, and the golden legend. If such was the fate of the most\n",
      "beautiful compositions of genius, what stability could be expected\n",
      "for the dull and barren works of an obsolete science? The books of\n",
      "jurisprudence were interesting to few, and entertaining to none: their\n",
      "value was connected with present use, and they sunk forever as soon as\n",
      "that use was superseded by the innovations of fashion, superior merit,\n",
      "or public authority. In the age of peace and learning, between Cicero\n",
      "and the last of the Antonines, many losses had been already sustained,\n",
      "and some luminaries of the school, or forum, were known only to the\n",
      "curious by tradition and report. Three hundred and sixty years of\n",
      "disorder and decay accelerated the progress of oblivion; and it may\n",
      "fairly be presumed, that of the writings, which Justinian is accused\n",
      "of neglecting, many were no longer to be found in the libraries of\n",
      "the East. The copies of Papinian, or Ulpian, which the reformer had\n",
      "proscribed, were deemed unworthy of future notice: the Twelve Tables and\n",
      "prÊtorian edicts insensibly vanished, and the monuments of ancient Rome\n",
      "were neglected or destroyed by the envy and ignorance of the Greeks.\n",
      "Even the Pandects themselves have escaped with difficulty and danger\n",
      "from the common shipwreck, and criticism has pronounced that _all_ the\n",
      "editions and manuscripts of the West are derived from _one_ original.\n",
      "It was transcribed at Constantinople in the beginning of the seventh\n",
      "century, was successively transported by the accidents of war and\n",
      "commerce to Amalphi, Pisa, and Florence, and is now deposited as a\n",
      "sacred relic in the ancient palace of the republic.\n",

      "It is the first care of a reformer to prevent any future reformation. To\n",
      "maintain the text of the Pandects, the Institutes, and the Code, the use\n",
      "of ciphers and abbreviations was rigorously proscribed; and as Justinian\n",
      "recollected, that the perpetual edict had been buried under the weight\n",
      "of commentators, he denounced the punishment of forgery against the rash\n",
      "civilians who should presume to interpret or pervert the will of their\n",
      "sovereign. The scholars of Accursius, of Bartolus, of Cujacius, should\n",
      "blush for their accumulated guilt, unless they dare to dispute his right\n",
      "of binding the authority of his successors, and the native freedom of\n",
      "the mind. But the emperor was unable to fix his own inconstancy; and,\n",
      "while he boasted of renewing the exchange of Diomede, of transmuting\n",
      "brass into gold, discovered the necessity of purifying his gold from the\n",
      "mixture of baser alloy. Six years had not elapsed from the publication\n",
      "of the Code, before he condemned the imperfect attempt, by a new and\n",
      "more accurate edition of the same work; which he enriched with two\n",
      "hundred of his own laws, and fifty decisions of the darkest and\n",
      "most intricate points of jurisprudence. Every year, or, according\n",
      "to Procopius, each day, of his long reign, was marked by some legal\n",
      "innovation. Many of his acts were rescinded by himself; many were\n",
      "rejected by his successors; many have been obliterated by time; but the\n",
      "number of sixteen Edicts, and one hundred and sixty-eight Novels, has\n",
      "been admitted into the authentic body of the civil jurisprudence. In the\n",
      "opinion of a philosopher superior to the prejudices of his profession,\n",
      "these incessant, and, for the most part, trifling alterations, can be\n",
      "only explained by the venal spirit of a prince, who sold without shame\n",
      "his judgments and his laws. The charge of the secret historian is indeed\n",
      "explicit and vehement; but the sole instance, which he produces, may\n",
      "be ascribed to the devotion as well as to the avarice of Justinian. A\n",
      "wealthy bigot had bequeathed his inheritance to the church of Emesa;\n",
      "and its value was enhanced by the dexterity of an artist, who subscribed\n",
      "confessions of debt and promises of payment with the names of the\n",
      "richest Syrians. They pleaded the established prescription of thirty or\n",
      "forty years; but their defence was overruled by a retrospective edict,\n",
      "which extended the claims of the church to the term of a century; an\n",
      "edict so pregnant with injustice and disorder, that, after serving this\n",
      "occasional purpose, it was prudently abolished in the same reign. If\n",
      "candor will acquit the emperor himself, and transfer the corruption\n",
      "to his wife and favorites, the suspicion of so foul a vice must still\n",
      "degrade the majesty of his laws; and the advocates of Justinian may\n",
      "acknowledge, that such levity, whatsoever be the motive, is unworthy of\n",
      "a legislator and a man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monarchs seldom condescend to become the preceptors of their subjects;\n",
      "and some praise is due to Justinian, by whose command an ample system\n",
      "was reduced to a short and elementary treatise. Among the various\n",
      "institutes of the Roman law, those of Caius were the most popular in the\n",
      "East and West; and their use may be considered as an evidence of\n",
      "their merit. They were selected by the Imperial delegates, Tribonian,\n",
      "Theophilus, and Dorotheus; and the freedom and purity of the Antonines\n",
      "was incrusted with the coarser materials of a degenerate age. The same\n",
      "volume which introduced the youth of Rome, Constantinople, and Berytus,\n",
      "to the gradual study of the Code and Pandects, is still precious to\n",
      "the historian, the philosopher, and the magistrate. The Institutes\n",
      "of Justinian are divided into four books: they proceed, with no\n",
      "contemptible method, from, I. _Persons_, to, II. _Things_, and from\n",

      "and limited government. In France, the remains of liberty are kept alive\n",
      "by the spirit, the honors, and even the prejudices, of fifty thousand\n",
      "nobles. Two hundred families supply, in lineal descent, the second\n",
      "branch of English legislature, which maintains, between the king and\n",
      "commons, the balance of the constitution. A gradation of patricians and\n",
      "plebeians, of strangers and subjects, has supported the aristocracy\n",
      "of Genoa, Venice, and ancient Rome. The perfect equality of men is the\n",
      "point in which the extremes of democracy and despotism are confounded;\n",
      "since the majesty of the prince or people would be offended, if\n",
      "any heads were exalted above the level of their fellow-slaves or\n",
      "fellow-citizens. In the decline of the Roman empire, the proud\n",
      "distinctions of the republic were gradually abolished, and the reason or\n",
      "instinct of Justinian completed the simple form of an absolute monarchy.\n",
      "The emperor could not eradicate the popular reverence which always\n",
      "waits on the possession of hereditary wealth, or the memory of famous\n",
      "ancestors. He delighted to honor, with titles and emoluments, his\n",
      "generals, magistrates, and senators; and his precarious indulgence\n",
      "communicated some rays of their glory to the persons of their wives and\n",
      "children. But in the eye of the law, all Roman citizens were equal,\n",
      "and all subjects of the empire were citizens of Rome. That inestimable\n",
      "character was degraded to an obsolete and empty name. The voice of a\n",
      "Roman could no longer enact his laws, or create the annual ministers of\n",
      "his power: his constitutional rights might have checked the arbitrary\n",
      "will of a master: and the bold adventurer from Germany or Arabia was\n",
      "admitted, with equal favor, to the civil and military command, which the\n",
      "citizen alone had been once entitled to assume over the conquests of his\n",
      "fathers. The first CÊsars had scrupulously guarded the distinction of\n",
      "_ingenuous_ and _servile_ birth, which was decided by the condition of\n",
      "the mother; and the candor of the laws was satisfied, if her freedom\n",
      "could be ascertained, during a single moment, between the conception\n",
      "and the delivery. The slaves, who were liberated by a generous master,\n",
      "immediately entered into the middle class of _libertines_ or freedmen;\n",
      "but they could never be enfranchised from the duties of obedience and\n",
      "gratitude; whatever were the fruits of their industry, their patron and\n",
      "his family inherited the third part; or even the whole of their fortune,\n",
      "if they died without children and without a testament. Justinian\n",
      "respected the rights of patrons; but his indulgence removed the badge of\n",
      "disgrace from the two inferior orders of freedmen; whoever ceased to be\n",
      "a slave, obtained, without reserve or delay, the station of a citizen;\n",
      "and at length the dignity of an ingenuous birth, which nature had\n",
      "refused, was created, or supposed, by the omnipotence of the emperor.\n",
      "Whatever restraints of age, or forms, or numbers, had been formerly\n",
      "introduced to check the abuse of manumissions, and the too rapid\n",
      "increase of vile and indigent Romans, he finally abolished; and the\n",
      "spirit of his laws promoted the extinction of domestic servitude.\n",
      "Yet the eastern provinces were filled, in the time of Justinian, with\n",
      "multitudes of slaves, either born or purchased for the use of their\n",
      "masters; and the price, from ten to seventy pieces of gold, was\n",
      "determined by their age, their strength, and their education. But the\n",
      "hardships of this dependent state were continually diminished by the\n",
      "influence of government and religion: and the pride of a subject was no\n",

      "The law of nature instructs most animals to cherish and educate their\n",
      "infant progeny. The law of reason inculcates to the human species the\n",

      "dominion of the father over his children, is peculiar to the Roman\n",
      "jurisprudence, and seems to be coeval with the foundation of the city.\n",
      "The paternal power was instituted or confirmed by Romulus himself; and,\n",
      "after the practice of three centuries, it was inscribed on the fourth\n",
      "table of the Decemvirs. In the forum, the senate, or the camp, the\n",
      "adult son of a Roman citizen enjoyed the public and private rights of a\n",
      "_person_: in his father's house he was a mere _thing_; confounded by the\n",
      "laws with the movables, the cattle, and the slaves, whom the capricious\n",
      "master might alienate or destroy, without being responsible to any\n",
      "earthly tribunal. The hand which bestowed the daily sustenance might\n",
      "resume the voluntary gift, and whatever was acquired by the labor or\n",
      "fortune of the son was immediately lost in the property of the father.\n",
      "His stolen goods (his oxen or his children) might be recovered by the\n",
      "same action of theft; and if either had been guilty of a trespass, it\n",
      "was in his own option to compensate the damage, or resign to the injured\n",
      "party the obnoxious animal. At the call of indigence or avarice, the\n",
      "master of a family could dispose of his children or his slaves. But the\n",
      "condition of the slave was far more advantageous, since he regained, by\n",
      "the first manumission, his alienated freedom: the son was again restored\n",
      "to his unnatural father; he might be condemned to servitude a second and\n",
      "a third time, and it was not till after the third sale and deliverance,\n",
      "that he was enfranchised from the domestic power which had been so\n",
      "repeatedly abused. According to his discretion, a father might\n",
      "chastise the real or imaginary faults of his children, by stripes, by\n",
      "imprisonment, by exile, by sending them to the country to work in chains\n",
      "among the meanest of his servants. The majesty of a parent was armed\n",
      "with the power of life and death; and the examples of such bloody\n",
      "executions, which were sometimes praised and never punished, may be\n",
      "traced in the annals of Rome beyond the times of Pompey and Augustus.\n",
      "Neither age, nor rank, nor the consular office, nor the honors of a\n",
      "triumph, could exempt the most illustrious citizen from the bonds of\n",
      "filial subjection: his own descendants were included in the family of\n",
      "their common ancestor; and the claims of adoption were not less sacred\n",
      "or less rigorous than those of nature. Without fear, though not\n",
      "without danger of abuse, the Roman legislators had reposed an unbounded\n",
      "confidence in the sentiments of paternal love; and the oppression was\n",
      "tempered by the assurance that each generation must succeed in its turn\n",
      "to the awful dignity of parent and master.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first limitation of paternal power is ascribed to the justice and\n",
      "humanity of Numa; and the maid who, with _his_ father's consent, had\n",
      "espoused a freeman, was protected from the disgrace of becoming the\n",
      "wife of a slave. In the first ages, when the city was pressed, and often\n",
      "famished, by her Latin and Tuscan neighbors, the sale of children might\n",
      "be a frequent practice; but as a Roman could not legally purchase the\n",
      "liberty of his fellow-citizen, the market must gradually fail, and the\n",
      "trade would be destroyed by the conquests of the republic. An imperfect\n",
      "right of property was at length communicated to sons; and the threefold\n",
      "distinction of _profectitious_, _adventitious_, and _professional_ was\n",
      "ascertained by the jurisprudence of the Code and Pandects. Of all that\n",
      "proceeded from the father, he imparted only the use, and reserved the\n",
      "absolute dominion; yet if his goods were sold, the filial portion\n",
      "was excepted, by a favorable interpretation, from the demands of\n",
      "the creditors. In whatever accrued by marriage, gift, or collateral\n",
      "succession, the property was secured to the son; but the father, unless\n",
      "he had been specially excluded, enjoyed the usufruct during his life.\n",
      "As a just and prudent reward of military virtue, the spoils of the enemy\n",
      "were acquired, possessed, and bequeathed by the soldier alone; and the\n",
      "fair analogy was extended to the emoluments of any liberal profession,\n",
      "the salary of public service, and the sacred liberality of the emperor\n",
      "or empress. The life of a citizen was less exposed than his fortune\n",
      "to the abuse of paternal power. Yet his life might be adverse to the\n",
      "interest or passions of an unworthy father: the same crimes that flowed\n",
      "from the corruption, were more sensibly felt by the humanity, of the\n",
      "Augustan age; and the cruel Erixo, who whipped his son till he expired,\n",
      "was saved by the emperor from the just fury of the multitude. The Roman\n",
      "father, from the license of servile dominion, was reduced to the\n",
      "gravity and moderation of a judge. The presence and opinion of Augustus\n",
      "confirmed the sentence of exile pronounced against an intentional\n",
      "parricide by the domestic tribunal of Arius. Adrian transported to\n",
      "an island the jealous parent, who, like a robber, had seized the\n",
      "opportunity of hunting, to assassinate a youth, the incestuous lover of\n",
      "his step-mother. A private jurisdiction is repugnant to the spirit of\n",
      "monarchy; the parent was again reduced from a judge to an accuser;\n",
      "and the magistrates were enjoined by Severus Alexander to hear his\n",
      "complaints and execute his sentence. He could no longer take the life\n",
      "of a son without incurring the guilt and punishment of murder; and the\n",
      "pains of parricide, from which he had been excepted by the Pompeian\n",
      "law, were finally inflicted by the justice of Constantine. The same\n",
      "protection was due to every period of existence; and reason must applaud\n",
      "the humanity of Paulus, for imputing the crime of murder to the father\n",
      "who strangles, or starves, or abandons his new-born infant; or exposes\n",
      "him in a public place to find the mercy which he himself had denied.\n",
      "But the exposition of children was the prevailing and stubborn vice of\n",
      "antiquity: it was sometimes prescribed, often permitted, almost always\n",
      "practised with impunity, by the nations who never entertained the Roman\n",
      "ideas of paternal power; and the dramatic poets, who appeal to the human\n",
      "heart, represent with indifference a popular custom which was palliated\n",
      "by the motives of economy and compassion. If the father could subdue\n",
      "his own feelings, he might escape, though not the censure, at least the\n",
      "chastisement, of the laws; and the Roman empire was stained with the\n",
      "blood of infants, till such murders were included, by Valentinian and\n",
      "his colleagues, in the letter and spirit of the Cornelian law. The\n",
      "lessons of jurisprudence and Christianity had been insufficient to\n",

      "bride of her parents, and she fulfilled the _coemption_ by purchasing,\n",
      "with three pieces of copper, a just introduction to his house and\n",
      "household deities. A sacrifice of fruits was offered by the pontiffs in\n",
      "the presence of ten witnesses; the contracting parties were seated on\n",
      "the same sheep-skin; they tasted a salt cake of _far_ or rice; and this\n",
      "_confarreation_, which denoted the ancient food of Italy, served as an\n",
      "emblem of their mystic union of mind and body. But this union on the\n",
      "side of the woman was rigorous and unequal; and she renounced the name\n",
      "and worship of her father's house, to embrace a new servitude, decorated\n",
      "only by the title of adoption, a fiction of the law, neither rational\n",
      "nor elegant, bestowed on the mother of a family (her proper appellation)\n",
      "the strange characters of sister to her own children, and of daughter to\n",
      "her husband or master, who was invested with the plenitude of paternal\n",
      "power. By his judgment or caprice her behavior was approved, or\n",
      "censured, or chastised; he exercised the jurisdiction of life and death;\n",
      "and it was allowed, that in the cases of adultery or drunkenness, the\n",
      "sentence might be properly inflicted. She acquired and inherited for\n",
      "the sole profit of her lord; and so clearly was woman defined, not as a\n",
      "_person_, but as a _thing_, that, if the original title were deficient,\n",
      "she might be claimed, like other movables, by the use and possession\n",
      "of an entire year. The inclination of the Roman husband discharged or\n",
      "withheld the conjugal debt, so scrupulously exacted by the Athenian and\n",

      "by the indulgence of fathers and lovers, and their ambition was\n",
      "unsuccessfully resisted by the gravity of Cato the Censor. They declined\n",
      "the solemnities of the old nuptials; defeated the annual prescription\n",
      "by an absence of three days; and, without losing their name or\n",
      "independence, subscribed the liberal and definite terms of a marriage\n",
      "contract. Of their private fortunes, they communicated the use, and\n",
      "secured the property: the estates of a wife could neither be alienated\n",
      "nor mortgaged by a prodigal husband; their mutual gifts were prohibited\n",
      "by the jealousy of the laws; and the misconduct of either party might\n",

      "To this loose and voluntary compact, religious and civil rights were no\n",

      "The dignity of marriage was restored by the Christians, who derived all\n",
      "spiritual grace from the prayers of the faithful and the benediction\n",
      "of the priest or bishop. The origin, validity, and duties of the holy\n",
      "institution were regulated by the tradition of the synagogue, the\n",
      "precepts of the gospel, and the canons of general or provincial synods;\n",
      "and the conscience of the Christians was awed by the decrees and\n",
      "censures of their ecclesiastical rulers. Yet the magistrates of\n",

      "\n",
      "Besides the agreement of the parties, the essence of every rational\n",

      "allowed to supersede the necessity of his consent. The causes of the\n",
      "dissolution of matrimony have varied among the Romans; but the most\n",
      "solemn sacrament, the confarreation itself, might always be done away by\n",
      "rites of a contrary tendency. In the first ages, the father of a family\n",
      "might sell his children, and his wife was reckoned in the number of his\n",
      "children: the domestic judge might pronounce the death of the offender,\n",
      "or his mercy might expel her from his bed and house; but the slavery of\n",
      "the wretched female was hopeless and perpetual, unless he asserted for\n",
      "his own convenience the manly prerogative of divorce. The warmest\n",
      "applause has been lavished on the virtue of the Romans, who abstained\n",
      "from the exercise of this tempting privilege above five hundred years:\n",
      "but the same fact evinces the unequal terms of a connection in which the\n",
      "slave was unable to renounce her tyrant, and the tyrant was unwilling\n",
      "to relinquish his slave. When the Roman matrons became the equal and\n",
      "voluntary companions of their lords, a new jurisprudence was introduced,\n",
      "that marriage, like other partnerships, might be dissolved by the\n",
      "abdication of one of the associates. In three centuries of prosperity\n",
      "and corruption, this principle was enlarged to frequent practice and\n",
      "pernicious abuse. Passion, interest, or caprice, suggested daily motives\n",
      "for the dissolution of marriage; a word, a sign, a message, a letter,\n",
      "the mandate of a freedman, declared the separation; the most tender\n",
      "of human connections was degraded to a transient society of profit\n",
      "or pleasure. According to the various conditions of life, both\n",
      "sexes alternately felt the disgrace and injury: an inconstant spouse\n",
      "transferred her wealth to a new family, abandoning a numerous, perhaps\n",
      "a spurious, progeny to the paternal authority and care of her late\n",
      "husband; a beautiful virgin might be dismissed to the world, old,\n",
      "indigent, and friendless; but the reluctance of the Romans, when they\n",
      "were pressed to marriage by Augustus, sufficiently marks, that the\n",
      "prevailing institutions were least favorable to the males. A specious\n",
      "theory is confuted by this free and perfect experiment, which\n",
      "demonstrates, that the liberty of divorce does not contribute to\n",
      "happiness and virtue. The facility of separation would destroy all\n",
      "mutual confidence, and inflame every trifling dispute: the minute\n",
      "difference between a husband and a stranger, which might so easily be\n",
      "removed, might still more easily be forgotten; and the matron, who in\n",
      "five years can submit to the embraces of eight husbands, must cease to\n",
      "reverence the chastity of her own person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Insufficient remedies followed with distant and tardy steps the rapid\n",
      "progress of the evil. The ancient worship of the Romans afforded a\n",
      "peculiar goddess to hear and reconcile the complaints of a married life;\n",
      "but her epithet of _Viriplaca_, the appeaser of husbands, too clearly\n",
      "indicates on which side submission and repentance were always expected.\n",
      "Every act of a citizen was subject to the judgment of the _censors_; the\n",
      "first who used the privilege of divorce assigned, at their command, the\n",
      "motives of his conduct; and a senator was expelled for dismissing his\n",
      "virgin spouse without the knowledge or advice of his friends. Whenever\n",
      "an action was instituted for the recovery of a marriage portion,\n",
      "the _prtor_, as the guardian of equity, examined the cause and the\n",
      "characters, and gently inclined the scale in favor of the guiltless\n",
      "and injured party. Augustus, who united the powers of both magistrates,\n",
      "adopted their different modes of repressing or chastising the license\n",
      "of divorce. The presence of seven Roman witnesses was required for the\n",
      "validity of this solemn and deliberate act: if any adequate provocation\n",
      "had been given by the husband, instead of the delay of two years, he was\n",
      "compelled to refund immediately, or in the space of six months; but\n",
      "if he could arraign the manners of his wife, her guilt or levity\n",
      "was expiated by the loss of the sixth or eighth part of her marriage\n",
      "portion. The Christian princes were the first who specified the just\n",
      "causes of a private divorce; their institutions, from Constantine to\n",
      "Justinian, appear to fluctuate between the custom of the empire and\n",
      "the wishes of the church, and the author of the Novels too frequently\n",
      "reforms the jurisprudence of the Code and Pandects. In the most rigorous\n",
      "laws, a wife was condemned to support a gamester, a drunkard, or a\n",
      "libertine, unless he were guilty of homicide, poison, or sacrilege, in\n",
      "which cases the marriage, as it should seem, might have been dissolved\n",
      "by the hand of the executioner. But the sacred right of the husband was\n",
      "invariably maintained, to deliver his name and family from the disgrace\n",
      "of adultery: the list of _mortal_ sins, either male or female, was\n",
      "curtailed and enlarged by successive regulations, and the obstacles of\n",
      "incurable impotence, long absence, and monastic profession, were\n",
      "allowed to rescind the matrimonial obligation. Whoever transgressed the\n",
      "permission of the law, was subject to various and heavy penalties. The\n",
      "woman was stripped of her wealth and ornaments, without excepting the\n",
      "bodkin of her hair: if the man introduced a new bride into his bed,\n",
      "_her_ fortune might be lawfully seized by the vengeance of his exiled\n",
      "wife. Forfeiture was sometimes commuted to a fine; the fine was\n",
      "sometimes aggravated by transportation to an island, or imprisonment in\n",
      "a monastery; the injured party was released from the bonds of marriage;\n",
      "but the offender, during life, or a term of years, was disabled from\n",
      "the repetition of nuptials. The successor of Justinian yielded to the\n",
      "prayers of his unhappy subjects, and restored the liberty of divorce\n",
      "by mutual consent: the civilians were unanimous, the theologians were\n",
      "divided, and the ambiguous word, which contains the precept of Christ,\n",
      "is flexible to any interpretation that the wisdom of a legislator can\n",
      "demand.\n",

      "The freedom of love and marriage was restrained among the Romans by\n",
      "natural and civil impediments. An instinct, almost innate and universal,\n",
      "appears to prohibit the incestuous commerce of parents and children in\n",
      "the infinite series of ascending and descending generations. Concerning\n",
      "the oblique and collateral branches, nature is indifferent, reason mute,\n",
      "and custom various and arbitrary. In Egypt, the marriage of brothers\n",

      "the nuptials of an uncle with his niece were applauded at Athens as a\n",
      "happy union of the dearest relations. The profane lawgivers of Rome\n",
      "were never tempted by interest or superstition to multiply the forbidden\n",
      "degrees: but they inflexibly condemned the marriage of sisters and\n",
      "brothers, hesitated whether first cousins should be touched by the same\n",
      "interdict; revered the parental character of aunts and uncles, and\n",
      "treated affinity and adoption as a just imitation of the ties of blood.\n",
      "According to the proud maxims of the republic, a legal marriage could\n",
      "only be contracted by free citizens; an honorable, at least an ingenuous\n",
      "birth, was required for the spouse of a senator: but the blood of kings\n",

      "injurious to the majesty, cannot without indulgence be applied to the\n",
      "manners, of these Oriental queens. A concubine, in the strict sense of\n",
      "the civilians, was a woman of servile or plebeian extraction, the sole\n",
      "and faithful companion of a Roman citizen, who continued in a state\n",
      "of celibacy. Her modest station, below the honors of a wife, above the\n",
      "infamy of a prostitute, was acknowledged and approved by the laws: from\n",
      "the age of Augustus to the tenth century, the use of this secondary\n",
      "marriage prevailed both in the West and East; and the humble virtues of\n",
      "a concubine were often preferred to the pomp and insolence of a noble\n",
      "matron. In this connection, the two Antonines, the best of princes and\n",
      "of men, enjoyed the comforts of domestic love: the example was imitated\n",
      "by many citizens impatient of celibacy, but regardful of their families.\n",
      "If at any time they desired to legitimate their natural children, the\n",
      "conversion was instantly performed by the celebration of their nuptials\n",

      "The relation of guardian and ward, or in Roman words of _tutor_ and\n",
      "_pupil_, which covers so many titles of the Institutes and Pandects,\n",
      "is of a very simple and uniform nature. The person and property of an\n",
      "orphan must always be trusted to the custody of some discreet friend.\n",
      "If the deceased father had not signified his choice, the _agnats_, or\n",
      "paternal kindred of the nearest degree, were compelled to act as the\n",
      "natural guardians: the Athenians were apprehensive of exposing the\n",
      "infant to the power of those most interested in his death; but an axiom\n",
      "of Roman jurisprudence has pronounced, that the charge of tutelage\n",
      "should constantly attend the emolument of succession. If the choice\n",
      "of the father, and the line of consanguinity, afforded no efficient\n",
      "guardian, the failure was supplied by the nomination of the prÊtor of\n",
      "the city, or the president of the province. But the person whom they\n",
      "named to this _public_ office might be legally excused by insanity or\n",
      "blindness, by ignorance or inability, by previous enmity or adverse\n",
      "interest, by the number of children or guardianships with which he was\n",
      "already burdened, and by the immunities which were granted to the useful\n",
      "labors of magistrates, lawyers, physicians, and professors. Till the\n",
      "infant could speak, and think, he was represented by the tutor, whose\n",
      "authority was finally determined by the age of puberty. Without his\n",
      "consent, no act of the pupil could bind himself to his own prejudice,\n",
      "though it might oblige others for his personal benefit. It is needless\n",
      "to observe, that the tutor often gave security, and always rendered an\n",
      "account, and that the want of diligence or integrity exposed him to a\n",
      "civil and almost criminal action for the violation of his sacred trust.\n",
      "The age of puberty had been rashly fixed by the civilians at fourteen;\n",
      "* but as the faculties of the mind ripen more slowly than those of the\n",
      "body, a _curator_ was interposed to guard the fortunes of a Roman youth\n",
      "from his own inexperience and headstrong passions. Such a trustee had\n",
      "been first instituted by the prÊtor, to save a family from the blind\n",
      "havoc of a prodigal or madman; and the minor was compelled, by the laws,\n",
      "to solicit the same protection, to give validity to his acts till he\n",
      "accomplished the full period of twenty-five years. Women were condemned\n",
      "to the perpetual tutelage of parents, husbands, or guardians; a sex\n",
      "created to please and obey was never supposed to have attained the age\n",
      "of reason and experience. Such, at least, was the stern and haughty\n",

      "the time of Justinian.\n",

      "II. The original right of property can only be justified by the accident\n",
      "or merit of prior occupancy; and on this foundation it is wisely\n",
      "established by the philosophy of the civilians. The savage who hollows a\n",
      "tree, inserts a sharp stone into a wooden handle, or applies a string to\n",
      "an elastic branch, becomes in a state of nature the just proprietor of\n",
      "the canoe, the bow, or the hatchet. The materials were common to all,\n",
      "the new form, the produce of his time and simple industry, belongs\n",
      "solely to himself. His hungry brethren cannot, without a sense of their\n",
      "own injustice, extort from the hunter the game of the forest overtaken\n",
      "or slain by his personal strength and dexterity. If his provident care\n",
      "preserves and multiplies the tame animals, whose nature is tractable\n",
      "to the arts of education, he acquires a perpetual title to the use and\n",
      "service of their numerous progeny, which derives its existence from him\n",
      "alone. If he encloses and cultivates a field for their sustenance and\n",
      "his own, a barren waste is converted into a fertile soil; the seed, the\n",
      "manure, the labor, create a new value, and the rewards of harvest\n",
      "are painfully earned by the fatigues of the revolving year. In the\n",
      "successive states of society, the hunter, the shepherd, the husbandman,\n",
      "may defend their possessions by two reasons which forcibly appeal to\n",
      "the feelings of the human mind: that whatever they enjoy is the fruit\n",
      "of their own industry; and that every man who envies their felicity,\n",
      "may purchase similar acquisitions by the exercise of similar diligence.\n",
      "Such, in truth, may be the freedom and plenty of a small colony cast\n",
      "on a fruitful island. But the colony multiplies, while the space still\n",
      "continues the same; the common rights, the equal inheritance of\n",
      "mankind, are engrossed by the bold and crafty; each field and forest\n",
      "is circumscribed by the landmarks of a jealous master; and it is the\n",
      "peculiar praise of the Roman jurisprudence, that it asserts the claim of\n",
      "the first occupant to the wild animals of the earth, the air, and the\n",
      "waters. In the progress from primitive equity to final injustice, the\n",
      "steps are silent, the shades are almost imperceptible, and the absolute\n",
      "monopoly is guarded by positive laws and artificial reason. The active,\n",
      "insatiate principle of self-love can alone supply the arts of life and\n",
      "the wages of industry; and as soon as civil government and exclusive\n",
      "property have been introduced, they become necessary to the existence\n",
      "of the human race. Except in the singular institutions of Sparta, the\n",
      "wisest legislators have disapproved an agrarian law as a false and\n",
      "dangerous innovation. Among the Romans, the enormous disproportion of\n",
      "wealth surmounted the ideal restraints of a doubtful tradition, and an\n",
      "obsolete statute; a tradition that the poorest follower of Romulus had\n",
      "been endowed with the perpetual inheritance of two _jugera_; a statute\n",
      "which confined the richest citizen to the measure of five hundred\n",
      "jugera, or three hundred and twelve acres of land. The original\n",
      "territory of Rome consisted only of some miles of wood and meadow along\n",
      "the banks of the Tyber; and domestic exchange could add nothing to the\n",
      "national stock. But the goods of an alien or enemy were lawfully exposed\n",
      "to the first hostile occupier; the city was enriched by the profitable\n",
      "trade of war; and the blood of her sons was the only price that was paid\n",
      "for the Volscian sheep, the slaves of Briton, or the gems and gold of\n",
      "Asiatic kingdoms. In the language of ancient jurisprudence, which was\n",
      "corrupted and forgotten before the age of Justinian, these spoils were\n",
      "distinguished by the name of _manceps_ or _mancipium_, taken with\n",
      "the hand; and whenever they were sold or _emancipated_, the purchaser\n",
      "required some assurance that they had been the property of an enemy,\n",
      "and not of a fellow-citizen. A citizen could only forfeit his rights by\n",
      "apparent dereliction, and such dereliction of a valuable interest\n",
      "could not easily be presumed. Yet, according to the Twelve Tables, a\n",
      "prescription of one year for movables, and of two years for immovables,\n",
      "abolished the claim of the ancient master, if the actual possessor had\n",
      "acquired them by a fair transaction from the person whom he believed\n",
      "to be the lawful proprietor. Such conscientious injustice, without any\n",
      "mixture of fraud or force could seldom injure the members of a small\n",
      "republic; but the various periods of three, of ten, or of twenty years,\n",
      "determined by Justinian, are more suitable to the latitude of a great\n",
      "empire. It is only in the term of prescription that the distinction of\n",
      "real and personal fortune has been remarked by the civilians; and\n",
      "their general idea of property is that of simple, uniform, and absolute\n",
      "dominion. The subordinate exceptions of _use_, of _usufruct_, of\n",
      "_servitude_, imposed for the benefit of a neighbor on lands and houses,\n",
      "are abundantly explained by the professors of jurisprudence. The claims\n",
      "of property, as far as they are altered by the mixture, the division,\n",
      "or the transformation of substances, are investigated with metaphysical\n",
      "subtilty by the same civilians.\n",
      "\n",
      "The personal title of the first proprietor must be determined by\n",
      "his death: but the possession, without any appearance of change, is\n",
      "peaceably continued in his children, the associates of his toil, and the\n",
      "partners of his wealth. This natural inheritance has been protected by\n",
      "the legislators of every climate and age, and the father is encouraged\n",
      "to persevere in slow and distant improvements, by the tender hope, that\n",
      "a long posterity will enjoy the fruits of his labor. The _principle_ of\n",
      "hereditary succession is universal; but the _order_ has been variously\n",
      "established by convenience or caprice, by the spirit of national\n",
      "institutions, or by some partial example which was originally decided\n",
      "by fraud or violence. The jurisprudence of the Romans appear to have\n",
      "deviated from the inequality of nature much less than the Jewish, the\n",
      "Athenian, or the English institutions. On the death of a citizen, all\n",
      "his descendants, unless they were already freed from his paternal\n",
      "power, were called to the inheritance of his possessions. The insolent\n",
      "prerogative of primogeniture was unknown; the two sexes were placed on a\n",
      "just level; all the sons and daughters were entitled to an equal portion\n",
      "of the patrimonial estate; and if any of the sons had been intercepted\n",
      "by a premature death, his person was represented, and his share was\n",
      "divided, by his surviving children. On the failure of the direct line,\n",
      "the right of succession must diverge to the collateral branches. The\n",
      "degrees of kindred are numbered by the civilians, ascending from the\n",
      "last possessor to a common parent, and descending from the common parent\n",
      "to the next heir: my father stands in the first degree, my brother in\n",
      "the second, his children in the third, and the remainder of the series\n",
      "may be conceived by a fancy, or pictured in a genealogical table. In\n",
      "this computation, a distinction was made, essential to the laws and even\n",
      "the constitution of Rome; the _agnats_, or persons connected by a line\n",
      "of males, were called, as they stood in the nearest degree, to an equal\n",
      "partition; but a female was incapable of transmitting any legal claims;\n",
      "and the _cognats_ of every rank, without excepting the dear relation of\n",
      "a mother and a son, were disinherited by the Twelve Tables, as strangers\n",
      "and aliens. Among the Romans _agens_ or lineage was united by a common\n",
      "_name_ and domestic rites; the various _cognomens_ or _surnames_ of\n",
      "Scipio, or Marcellus, distinguished from each other the subordinate\n",
      "branches or families of the Cornelian or Claudian race: the default\n",
      "of the _agnats_, of the same surname, was supplied by the larger\n",
      "denomination of _gentiles_; and the vigilance of the laws maintained, in\n",
      "the same name, the perpetual descent of religion and property. A similar\n",
      "principle dictated the Voconian law, which abolished the right of female\n",
      "inheritance. As long as virgins were given or sold in marriage, the\n",
      "adoption of the wife extinguished the hopes of the daughter. But the\n",
      "equal succession of independent matrons supported their pride and\n",
      "luxury, and might transport into a foreign house the riches of\n",
      "their fathers. While the maxims of Cato were revered, they tended to\n",
      "perpetuate in each family a just and virtuous mediocrity: till female\n",
      "blandishments insensibly triumphed; and every salutary restraint was\n",
      "lost in the dissolute greatness of the republic. The rigor of the\n",
      "decemvirs was tempered by the equity of the prÊtors. Their edicts\n",
      "restored and emancipated posthumous children to the rights of nature;\n",
      "and upon the failure of the _agnats_, they preferred the blood of the\n",
      "_cognats_ to the name of the gentiles whose title and character were\n",
      "insensibly covered with oblivion. The reciprocal inheritance of mothers\n",
      "and sons was established in the Tertullian and Orphitian decrees by the\n",
      "humanity of the senate. A new and more impartial order was introduced by\n",
      "the Novels of Justinian, who affected to revive the jurisprudence of\n",
      "the Twelve Tables. The lines of masculine and female kindred were\n",
      "confounded: the descending, ascending, and collateral series was\n",
      "accurately defined; and each degree, according tot he proximity of blood\n",
      "and affection, succeeded to the vacant possessions of a Roman citizen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The order of succession is regulated by nature, or at least by the\n",
      "general and permanent reason of the lawgiver: but this order is\n",
      "frequently violated by the arbitrary and partial _wills_, which prolong\n",
      "the dominion of the testator beyond the grave. In the simple state\n",
      "of society, this last use or abuse of the right of property is seldom\n",
      "indulged: it was introduced at Athens by the laws of Solon; and the\n",
      "private testaments of the father of a family are authorized by the\n",
      "Twelve Tables. Before the time of the decemvirs, a Roman citizen exposed\n",
      "his wishes and motives to the assembly of the thirty curiÊ or parishes,\n",
      "and the general law of inheritance was suspended by an occasional act\n",
      "of the legislature. After the permission of the decemvirs, each private\n",
      "lawgiver promulgated his verbal or written testament in the presence of\n",
      "five citizens, who represented the five classes of the Roman people; a\n",
      "sixth witness attested their concurrence; a seventh weighed the copper\n",
      "money, which was paid by an imaginary purchaser; and the estate was\n",
      "emancipated by a fictitious sale and immediate release. This singular\n",
      "ceremony, which excited the wonder of the Greeks, was still practised in\n",
      "the age of Severus; but the prÊtors had already approved a more simple\n",
      "testament, for which they required the seals and signatures of seven\n",
      "witnesses, free from all legal exception, and purposely summoned for the\n",
      "execution of that important act. A domestic monarch, who reigned\n",
      "over the lives and fortunes of his children, might distribute their\n",
      "respective shares according to the degrees of their merit or his\n",
      "affection; his arbitrary displeasure chastised an unworthy son by the\n",
      "loss of his inheritance, and the mortifying preference of a stranger.\n",
      "But the experience of unnatural parents recommended some limitations of\n",
      "their testamentary powers. A son, or, by the laws of Justinian, even a\n",
      "daughter, could no longer be disinherited by their silence: they were\n",
      "compelled to name the criminal, and to specify the offence; and the\n",
      "justice of the emperor enumerated the sole causes that could justify\n",
      "such a violation of the first principles of nature and society. Unless\n",
      "a legitimate portion, a fourth part, had been reserved for the children,\n",
      "they were entitled to institute an action or complaint of _inofficious_\n",
      "testament; to suppose that their father's understanding was impaired by\n",
      "sickness or age; and respectfully to appeal from his rigorous sentence\n",
      "to the deliberate wisdom of the magistrate. In the Roman jurisprudence,\n",
      "an essential distinction was admitted between the inheritance and the\n",
      "legacies. The heirs who succeeded to the entire unity, or to any of the\n",
      "twelve fractions of the substance of the testator, represented his civil\n",
      "and religious character, asserted his rights, fulfilled his obligations,\n",
      "and discharged the gifts of friendship or liberality, which his last\n",
      "will had bequeathed under the name of legacies. But as the imprudence or\n",
      "prodigality of a dying man might exhaust the inheritance, and leave\n",
      "only risk and labor to his successor, he was empowered to retain the\n",
      "_Falcidian_ portion; to deduct, before the payment of the legacies, a\n",
      "clear fourth for his own emolument. A reasonable time was allowed to\n",
      "examine the proportion between the debts and the estate, to decide\n",
      "whether he should accept or refuse the testament; and if he used the\n",
      "benefit of an inventory, the demands of the creditors could not exceed\n",
      "the valuation of the effects. The last will of a citizen might be\n",
      "altered during his life, or rescinded after his death: the persons whom\n",
      "he named might die before him, or reject the inheritance, or be exposed\n",
      "to some legal disqualification. In the contemplation of these events,\n",
      "he was permitted to substitute second and third heirs, to replace each\n",
      "other according to the order of the testament; and the incapacity of\n",
      "a madman or an infant to bequeath his property might be supplied by a\n",
      "similar substitution. But the power of the testator expired with the\n",
      "acceptance of the testament: each Roman of mature age and discretion\n",
      "acquired the absolute dominion of his inheritance, and the simplicity of\n",
      "the civil law was never clouded by the long and intricate entails which\n",
      "confine the happiness and freedom of unborn generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conquest and the formalities of law established the use of _codicils_.\n",
      "If a Roman was surprised by death in a remote province of the empire,\n",
      "he addressed a short epistle to his legitimate or testamentary heir;\n",
      "who fulfilled with honor, or neglected with impunity, this last request,\n",
      "which the judges before the age of Augustus were not authorized to\n",
      "enforce. A codicil might be expressed in any mode, or in any language;\n",
      "but the subscription of five witnesses must declare that it was the\n",
      "genuine composition of the author. His intention, however laudable, was\n",
      "sometimes illegal; and the invention of _fidei-commissa_, or\n",
      "trusts, arose form the struggle between natural justice and positive\n",
      "jurisprudence. A stranger of Greece or Africa might be the friend or\n",
      "benefactor of a childless Roman, but none, except a fellow-citizen,\n",
      "could act as his heir. The Voconian law, which abolished female\n",
      "succession, restrained the legacy or inheritance of a woman to the sum\n",
      "of one hundred thousand sesterces; and an only daughter was condemned\n",
      "almost as an alien in her father's house. The zeal of friendship, and\n",
      "parental affection, suggested a liberal artifice: a qualified citizen\n",
      "was named in the testament, with a prayer or injunction that he would\n",
      "restore the inheritance to the person for whom it was truly intended.\n",
      "Various was the conduct of the trustees in this painful situation: they\n",
      "had sworn to observe the laws of their country, but honor prompted them\n",
      "to violate their oath; and if they preferred their interest under the\n",
      "mask of patriotism, they forfeited the esteem of every virtuous mind.\n",
      "The declaration of Augustus relieved their doubts, gave a legal sanction\n",
      "to confidential testaments and codicils, and gently unravelled the forms\n",
      "and restraints of the republican jurisprudence. But as the new practice\n",
      "of trusts degenerated into some abuse, the trustee was enabled, by the\n",
      "Trebellian and Pegasian decrees, to reserve one fourth of the estate,\n",
      "or to transfer on the head of the real heir all the debts and actions of\n",
      "the succession. The interpretation of testaments was strict and literal;\n",
      "but the language of _trusts_ and codicils was delivered from the minute\n",
      "and technical accuracy of the civilians.\n",

      "III. The general duties of mankind are imposed by their public and\n",
      "private relations: but their specific _obligations_ to each other can\n",

      "when these obligations are ratified by law, the interested party may\n",

      "\n",
      "1. The goddess of _faith_ (of human and social faith) was worshipped,\n",
      "not only in her temples, but in the lives of the Romans; and if that\n",
      "nation was deficient in the more amiable qualities of benevolence and\n",
      "generosity, they astonished the Greeks by their sincere and simple\n",
      "performance of the most burdensome engagements. Yet among the same\n",
      "people, according to the rigid maxims of the patricians and decemvirs,\n",
      "a _naked pact_, a promise, or even an oath, did not create any\n",
      "civil obligation, unless it was confirmed by the legal form of a\n",
      "_stipulation_. Whatever might be the etymology of the Latin word, it\n",
      "conveyed the idea of a firm and irrevocable contract, which was always\n",
      "expressed in the mode of a question and answer. Do you promise to pay me\n",
      "one hundred pieces of gold? was the solemn interrogation of Seius. I\n",
      "do promise, was the reply of Sempronius. The friends of Sempronius, who\n",
      "answered for his ability and inclination, might be separately sued\n",
      "at the option of Seius; and the benefit of partition, or order of\n",
      "reciprocal actions, insensibly deviated from the strict theory of\n",
      "stipulation. The most cautious and deliberate consent was justly\n",
      "required to sustain the validity of a gratuitous promise; and the\n",
      "citizen who might have obtained a legal security, incurred the suspicion\n",
      "of fraud, and paid the forfeit of his neglect. But the ingenuity of the\n",
      "civilians successfully labored to convert simple engagements into the\n",
      "form of solemn stipulations. The prÊtors, as the guardians of social\n",
      "faith, admitted every rational evidence of a voluntary and deliberate\n",
      "act, which in their tribunal produced an equitable obligation, and for\n",
      "which they gave an action and a remedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The obligations of the second class, as they were contracted by the\n",
      "delivery of a thing, are marked by the civilians with the epithet of\n",
      "real. A grateful return is due to the author of a benefit; and whoever\n",
      "is intrusted with the property of another, has bound himself to the\n",
      "sacred duty of restitution. In the case of a friendly loan, the merit of\n",
      "generosity is on the side of the lender only; in a deposit, on the side\n",
      "of the receiver; but in a _pledge_, and the rest of the selfish commerce\n",
      "of ordinary life, the benefit is compensated by an equivalent, and\n",
      "the obligation to restore is variously modified by the nature of the\n",
      "transaction. The Latin language very happily expresses the fundamental\n",
      "difference between the _commodatum_ and the _mutuum_, which our poverty\n",
      "is reduced to confound under the vague and common appellation of a loan.\n",
      "In the former, the borrower was obliged to restore the same individual\n",
      "thing with which he had been _accommodated_ for the temporary supply of\n",
      "his wants; in the latter, it was destined for his use and consumption,\n",
      "and he discharged this _mutual_ engagement, by substituting the same\n",
      "specific value according to a just estimation of number, of weight,\n",
      "and of measure. In the contract of _sale_, the absolute dominion is\n",
      "transferred to the purchaser, and he repays the benefit with an adequate\n",
      "sum of gold or silver, the price and universal standard of all earthly\n",
      "possessions. The obligation of another contract, that of _location_, is\n",
      "of a more complicated kind. Lands or houses, labor or talents, may be\n",
      "hired for a definite term; at the expiration of the time, the thing\n",
      "itself must be restored to the owner, with an additional reward for the\n",
      "beneficial occupation and employment. In these lucrative contracts, to\n",
      "which may be added those of partnership and commissions, the civilians\n",
      "sometimes imagine the delivery of the object, and sometimes presume the\n",
      "consent of the parties. The substantial pledge has been refined into\n",
      "the invisible rights of a mortgage or _hypotheca_; and the agreement\n",
      "of sale, for a certain price, imputes, from that moment, the chances of\n",
      "gain or loss to the account of the purchaser. It may be fairly supposed,\n",
      "that every man will obey the dictates of his interest; and if he accepts\n",
      "the benefit, he is obliged to sustain the expense, of the transaction.\n",
      "In this boundless subject, the historian will observe the _location_ of\n",
      "land and money, the rent of the one and the interest of the other, as\n",
      "they materially affect the prosperity of agriculture and commerce.\n",
      "The landlord was often obliged to advance the stock and instruments of\n",
      "husbandry, and to content himself with a partition of the fruits. If the\n",
      "feeble tenant was oppressed by accident, contagion, or hostile violence,\n",
      "he claimed a proportionable relief from the equity of the laws: five\n",
      "years were the customary term, and no solid or costly improvements could\n",
      "be expected from a farmer, who, at each moment might be ejected by the\n",
      "sale of the estate. Usury, the inveterate grievance of the city, had\n",
      "been discouraged by the Twelve Tables, and abolished by the clamors of\n",
      "the people. It was revived by their wants and idleness, tolerated by\n",
      "the discretion of the prÊtors, and finally determined by the Code of\n",
      "Justinian. Persons of illustrious rank were confined to the moderate\n",
      "profit of _four per cent_.; six was pronounced to be the ordinary and\n",
      "legal standard of interest; eight was allowed for the convenience of\n",
      "manufactures and merchants; twelve was granted to nautical insurance,\n",
      "which the wiser ancients had not attempted to define; but, except in\n",
      "this perilous adventure, the practice of exorbitant usury was severely\n",
      "restrained. The most simple interest was condemned by the clergy of the\n",
      "East and West; but the sense of mutual benefit, which had triumphed over\n",
      "the law of the republic, has resisted with equal firmness the decrees of\n",
      "the church, and even the prejudices of mankind.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Nature and society impose the strict obligation of repairing an\n",
      "injury; and the sufferer by private injustice acquires a personal right\n",
      "and a legitimate action. If the property of another be intrusted to our\n",
      "care, the requisite degree of care may rise and fall according to the\n",
      "benefit which we derive from such temporary possession; we are seldom\n",
      "made responsible for inevitable accident, but the consequences of a\n",
      "voluntary fault must always be imputed to the author. A Roman pursued\n",
      "and recovered his stolen goods by a civil action of theft; they might\n",
      "pass through a succession of pure and innocent hands, but nothing less\n",
      "than a prescription of thirty years could extinguish his original claim.\n",
      "They were restored by the sentence of the prÊtor, and the injury was\n",
      "compensated by double, or threefold, or even quadruple damages, as the\n",
      "deed had been perpetrated by secret fraud or open rapine, as the robber\n",
      "had been surprised in the fact, or detected by a subsequent research.\n",
      "The Aquilian law defended the living property of a citizen, his slaves\n",
      "and cattle, from the stroke of malice or negligence: the highest price\n",
      "was allowed that could be ascribed to the domestic animal at any moment\n",
      "of the year preceding his death; a similar latitude of thirty days was\n",
      "granted on the destruction of any other valuable effects. A personal\n",
      "injury is blunted or sharpened by the manners of the times and the\n",
      "sensibility of the individual: the pain or the disgrace of a word or\n",
      "blow cannot easily be appreciated by a pecuniary equivalent. The rude\n",
      "jurisprudence of the decemvirs had confounded all hasty insults, which\n",
      "did not amount to the fracture of a limb, by condemning the aggressor to\n",
      "the common penalty of twenty-five _asses_. But the same denomination\n",
      "of money was reduced, in three centuries, from a pound to the weight of\n",
      "half an ounce: and the insolence of a wealthy Roman indulged himself\n",
      "in the cheap amusement of breaking and satisfying the law of the twelve\n",
      "tables. Veratius ran through the streets striking on the face the\n",
      "inoffensive passengers, and his attendant purse-bearer immediately\n",
      "silenced their clamors by the legal tender of twenty-five pieces of\n",
      "copper, about the value of one shilling. The equity of the prÊtors\n",
      "examined and estimated the distinct merits of each particular complaint.\n",
      "In the adjudication of civil damages, the magistrate assumed a right\n",
      "to consider the various circumstances of time and place, of age and\n",
      "dignity, which may aggravate the shame and sufferings of the injured\n",
      "person; but if he admitted the idea of a fine, a punishment, an example,\n",
      "he invaded the province, though, perhaps, he supplied the defects, of\n",
      "the criminal law.\n",
      "\n",
      "The execution of the Alban dictator, who was dismembered by eight\n",
      "horses, is represented by Livy as the first and the fast instance of\n",
      "Roman cruelty in the punishment of the most atrocious crimes. But this\n",
      "act of justice, or revenge, was inflicted on a foreign enemy in the heat\n",
      "of victory, and at the command of a single man. The twelve tables afford\n",
      "a more decisive proof of the national spirit, since they were framed by\n",
      "the wisest of the senate, and accepted by the free voices of the people;\n",
      "yet these laws, like the statutes of Draco, are written in characters\n",
      "of blood. They approve the inhuman and unequal principle of retaliation;\n",
      "and the forfeit of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a limb for a\n",
      "limb, is rigorously exacted, unless the offender can redeem his pardon\n",
      "by a fine of three hundred pounds of copper. The decemvirs distributed\n",
      "with much liberality the slighter chastisements of flagellation and\n",
      "servitude; and nine crimes of a very different complexion are adjudged\n",
      "worthy of death. _1._ Any act of _treason_ against the state, or of\n",
      "correspondence with the public enemy. The mode of execution was painful\n",
      "and ignominious: the head of the degenerate Roman was shrouded in\n",
      "a veil, his hands were tied behind his back, and after he had been\n",
      "scourged by the lictor, he was suspended in the midst of the forum on\n",
      "a cross, or inauspicious tree. _2._ Nocturnal meetings in the city;\n",
      "whatever might be the pretence, of pleasure, or religion, or the public\n",
      "good. _3._ The murder of a citizen; for which the common feelings of\n",
      "mankind demand the blood of the murderer. Poison is still more odious\n",
      "than the sword or dagger; and we are surprised to discover, in two\n",
      "flagitious events, how early such subtle wickedness had infected the\n",
      "simplicity of the republic, and the chaste virtues of the Roman matrons.\n",
      "The parricide, who violated the duties of nature and gratitude, was cast\n",
      "into the river or the sea, enclosed in a sack; and a cock, a viper,\n",
      "a dog, and a monkey, were successively added, as the most suitable\n",
      "companions. Italy produces no monkeys; but the want could never be\n",
      "felt, till the middle of the sixth century first revealed the guilt of\n",
      "a parricide. _4._The malice of an _incendiary_. After the previous\n",
      "ceremony of whipping, he himself was delivered to the flames; and in\n",
      "this example alone our reason is tempted to applaud the justice of\n",
      "retaliation. _5._ _Judicial perjury_. The corrupt or malicious witness\n",
      "was thrown headlong from the Tarpeian rock, to expiate his falsehood,\n",
      "which was rendered still more fatal by the severity of the penal laws,\n",
      "and the deficiency of written evidence. _6._ The corruption of a judge,\n",
      "who accepted bribes to pronounce an iniquitous sentence. _7._ Libels\n",
      "and satires, whose rude strains sometimes disturbed the peace of\n",
      "an illiterate city. The author was beaten with clubs, a worthy\n",
      "chastisement, but it is not certain that he was left to expire under\n",
      "the blows of the executioner. _8._ The nocturnal mischief of damaging or\n",
      "destroying a neighbor's corn. The criminal was suspended as a grateful\n",
      "victim to Ceres. But the sylvan deities were less implacable, and the\n",
      "extirpation of a more valuable tree was compensated by the moderate fine\n",
      "of twenty-five pounds of copper. _9._ Magical incantations; which had\n",
      "power, in the opinion of the Latin shepherds, to exhaust the strength\n",
      "of an enemy, to extinguish his life, and to remove from their seats\n",
      "his deep-rooted plantations. The cruelty of the twelve tables against\n",
      "insolvent debtors still remains to be told; and I shall dare to prefer\n",
      "the literal sense of antiquity to the specious refinements of modern\n",
      "criticism. After the judicial proof or confession of the debt, thirty\n",
      "days of grace were allowed before a Roman was delivered into the power\n",
      "of his fellow-citizen. In this private prison, twelve ounces of rice\n",
      "were his daily food; he might be bound with a chain of fifteen pounds\n",
      "weight; and his misery was thrice exposed in the market place, to\n",
      "solicit the compassion of his friends and countrymen. At the expiration\n",
      "of sixty days, the debt was discharged by the loss of liberty or life;\n",
      "the insolvent debtor was either put to death, or sold in foreign slavery\n",
      "beyond the Tyber: but, if several creditors were alike obstinate and\n",
      "unrelenting, they might legally dismember his body, and satiate their\n",
      "revenge by this horrid partition. The advocates for this savage law have\n",
      "insisted, that it must strongly operate in deterring idleness and\n",
      "fraud from contracting debts which they were unable to discharge; but\n",
      "experience would dissipate this salutary terror, by proving that no\n",
      "creditor could be found to exact this unprofitable penalty of life or\n",
      "limb. As the manners of Rome were insensibly polished, the criminal code\n",
      "of the decemvirs was abolished by the humanity of accusers, witnesses,\n",
      "and judges; and impunity became the consequence of immoderate rigor. The\n",
      "Porcian and Valerian laws prohibited the magistrates from inflicting\n",
      "on a free citizen any capital, or even corporal, punishment; and the\n",
      "obsolete statutes of blood were artfully, and perhaps truly, ascribed to\n",
      "the spirit, not of patrician, but of regal, tyranny.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the absence of penal laws, and the insufficiency of civil actions,\n",
      "the peace and justice of the city were imperfectly maintained by the\n",

      "jails are the outcasts of society, and the crimes for which they suffer\n",

      "the perpetration of similar enormities, a vile plebeian might claim\n",
      "and abuse the sacred character of a member of the republic: but, on the\n",

      "a cross; and this strict and summary justice might be exercised without\n",
      "restraint over the greatest part of the populace of Rome. Each family\n",
      "contained a domestic tribunal, which was not confined, like that of the\n",
      "prÊtor, to the cognizance of external actions: virtuous principles and\n",
      "habits were inculcated by the discipline of education; and the Roman\n",
      "father was accountable to the state for the manners of his children,\n",
      "since he disposed, without appeal, of their life, their liberty,\n",
      "and their inheritance. In some pressing emergencies, the citizen was\n",
      "authorized to avenge his private or public wrongs. The consent of the\n",
      "Jewish, the Athenian, and the Roman laws approved the slaughter of the\n",
      "nocturnal thief; though in open daylight a robber could not be slain\n",
      "without some previous evidence of danger and complaint. Whoever\n",
      "surprised an adulterer in his nuptial bed might freely exercise\n",
      "his revenge; the most bloody and wanton outrage was excused by the\n",
      "provocation; nor was it before the reign of Augustus that the husband\n",
      "was reduced to weigh the rank of the offender, or that the parent was\n",
      "condemned to sacrifice his daughter with her guilty seducer. After the\n",
      "expulsion of the kings, the ambitious Roman, who should dare to assume\n",
      "their title or imitate their tyranny, was devoted to the infernal gods:\n",
      "each of his fellow-citizens was armed with the sword of justice; and\n",
      "the act of Brutus, however repugnant to gratitude or prudence, had\n",
      "been already sanctified by the judgment of his country. The barbarous\n",
      "practice of wearing arms in the midst of peace, and the bloody maxims of\n",
      "honor, were unknown to the Romans; and, during the two purest ages, from\n",
      "the establishment of equal freedom to the end of the Punic wars, the\n",
      "city was never disturbed by sedition, and rarely polluted with atrocious\n",
      "crimes. The failure of penal laws was more sensibly felt, when every\n",
      "vice was inflamed by faction at home and dominion abroad. In the time\n",
      "of Cicero, each private citizen enjoyed the privilege of anarchy; each\n",
      "minister of the republic was exalted to the temptations of regal power,\n",
      "and their virtues are entitled to the warmest praise, as the spontaneous\n",
      "fruits of nature or philosophy. After a triennial indulgence of lust,\n",
      "rapine, and cruelty, Verres, the tyrant of Sicily, could only be sued\n",
      "for the pecuniary restitution of three hundred thousand pounds sterling;\n",
      "and such was the temper of the laws, the judges, and perhaps the accuser\n",
      "himself, that, on refunding a thirteenth part of his plunder, Verres\n",
      "could retire to an easy and luxurious exile.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first imperfect attempt to restore the proportion of crimes and\n",
      "punishments was made by the dictator Sylla, who, in the midst of his\n",
      "sanguinary triumph, aspired to restrain the license, rather than\n",
      "to oppress the liberty, of the Romans. He gloried in the arbitrary\n",
      "proscription of four thousand seven hundred citizens. But, in the\n",
      "character of a legislator, he respected the prejudices of the times;\n",
      "and, instead of pronouncing a sentence of death against the robber or\n",
      "assassin, the general who betrayed an army, or the magistrate who ruined\n",
      "a province, Sylla was content to aggravate the pecuniary damages by\n",
      "the penalty of exile, or, in more constitutional language, by the\n",
      "interdiction of fire and water. The Cornelian, and afterwards\n",
      "the Pompeian and Julian, laws introduced a new system of criminal\n",
      "jurisprudence; and the emperors, from Augustus to Justinian, disguised\n",
      "their increasing rigor under the names of the original authors. But the\n",
      "invention and frequent use of _extraordinary pains_ proceeded from\n",
      "the desire to extend and conceal the progress of despotism. In the\n",
      "condemnation of illustrious Romans, the senate was always prepared to\n",
      "confound, at the will of their masters, the judicial and legislative\n",
      "powers. It was the duty of the governors to maintain the peace of their\n",
      "province, by the arbitrary and rigid administration of justice; the\n",
      "freedom of the city evaporated in the extent of empire, and the Spanish\n",
      "malefactor, who claimed the privilege of a Roman, was elevated by the\n",
      "command of Galba on a fairer and more lofty cross. Occasional rescripts\n",
      "issued from the throne to decide the questions which, by their novelty\n",
      "or importance, appeared to surpass the authority and discernment of\n",
      "a proconsul. Transportation and beheading were reserved for honorable\n",
      "persons; meaner criminals were either hanged, or burnt, or buried in the\n",
      "mines, or exposed to the wild beasts of the amphitheatre. Armed robbers\n",
      "were pursued and extirpated as the enemies of society; the driving\n",
      "away horses or cattle was made a capital offence; but simple theft was\n",
      "uniformly considered as a mere civil and private injury. The degrees\n",
      "of guilt, and the modes of punishment, were too often determined by the\n",
      "discretion of the rulers, and the subject was left in ignorance of the\n",
      "legal danger which he might incur by every action of his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sin, a vice, a crime, are the objects of theology, ethics, and\n",
      "jurisprudence. Whenever their judgments agree, they corroborate each\n",
      "other; but, as often as they differ, a prudent legislator appreciates\n",
      "the guilt and punishment according to the measure of social injury. On\n",
      "this principle, the most daring attack on the life and property of a\n",
      "private citizen is judged less atrocious than the crime of treason or\n",
      "rebellion, which invades the _majesty_ of the republic: the obsequious\n",
      "civilians unanimously pronounced, that the republic is contained in the\n",
      "person of its chief; and the edge of the Julian law was sharpened by\n",
      "the incessant diligence of the emperors. The licentious commerce of the\n",
      "sexes may be tolerated as an impulse of nature, or forbidden as a source\n",
      "of disorder and corruption; but the fame, the fortunes, the family of\n",
      "the husband, are seriously injured by the adultery of the wife. The\n",
      "wisdom of Augustus, after curbing the freedom of revenge, applied to\n",
      "this domestic offence the animadversion of the laws: and the guilty\n",
      "parties, after the payment of heavy forfeitures and fines, were\n",
      "condemned to long or perpetual exile in two separate islands. Religion\n",
      "pronounces an equal censure against the infidelity of the husband; but,\n",
      "as it is not accompanied by the same civil effects, the wife was never\n",
      "permitted to vindicate her wrongs; and the distinction of simple or\n",
      "double adultery, so familiar and so important in the canon law, is\n",
      "unknown to the jurisprudence of the Code and the Pandects. I touch with\n",
      "reluctance, and despatch with impatience, a more odious vice, of which\n",
      "modesty rejects the name, and nature abominates the idea. The primitive\n",
      "Romans were infected by the example of the Etruscans and Greeks: and in\n",
      "the mad abuse of prosperity and power, every pleasure that is innocent\n",
      "was deemed insipid; and the Scatinian law, which had been extorted by an\n",
      "act of violence, was insensibly abolished by the lapse of time and the\n",
      "multitude of criminals. By this law, the rape, perhaps the seduction, of\n",
      "an ingenuous youth, was compensated, as a personal injury, by the poor\n",
      "damages of ten thousand sesterces, or fourscore pounds; the ravisher\n",
      "might be slain by the resistance or revenge of chastity; and I wish\n",
      "to believe, that at Rome, as in Athens, the voluntary and effeminate\n",
      "deserter of his sex was degraded from the honors and the rights of a\n",
      "citizen. But the practice of vice was not discouraged by the severity\n",
      "of opinion: the indelible stain of manhood was confounded with the\n",
      "more venial transgressions of fornication and adultery, nor was the\n",
      "licentious lover exposed to the same dishonor which he impressed on the\n",
      "male or female partner of his guilt. From Catullus to Juvenal, the poets\n",
      "accuse and celebrate the degeneracy of the times; and the reformation\n",
      "of manners was feebly attempted by the reason and authority of the\n",

      "\n",
      "A new spirit of legislation, respectable even in its error, arose in the\n",
      "empire with the religion of Constantine. The laws of Moses were received\n",
      "as the divine original of justice, and the Christian princes adapted\n",
      "their penal statutes to the degrees of moral and religious turpitude.\n",
      "Adultery was first declared to be a capital offence: the frailty of\n",
      "the sexes was assimilated to poison or assassination, to sorcery or\n",
      "parricide; the same penalties were inflicted on the passive and active\n",
      "guilt of pÊderasty; and all criminals of free or servile condition were\n",
      "either drowned or beheaded, or cast alive into the avenging flames. The\n",
      "adulterers were spared by the common sympathy of mankind; but the lovers\n",
      "of their own sex were pursued by general and pious indignation: the\n",
      "impure manners of Greece still prevailed in the cities of Asia, and\n",
      "every vice was fomented by the celibacy of the monks and clergy.\n",
      "Justinian relaxed the punishment at least of female infidelity: the\n",
      "guilty spouse was only condemned to solitude and penance, and at the end\n",
      "of two years she might be recalled to the arms of a forgiving husband.\n",
      "But the same emperor declared himself the implacable enemy of unmanly\n",
      "lust, and the cruelty of his persecution can scarcely be excused by the\n",
      "purity of his motives. In defiance of every principle of justice, he\n",
      "stretched to past as well as future offences the operations of his\n",
      "edicts, with the previous allowance of a short respite for confession\n",
      "and pardon. A painful death was inflicted by the amputation of the\n",
      "sinful instrument, or the insertion of sharp reeds into the pores\n",
      "and tubes of most exquisite sensibility; and Justinian defended the\n",
      "propriety of the execution, since the criminals would have lost their\n",
      "hands, had they been convicted of sacrilege. In this state of disgrace\n",
      "and agony, two bishops, Isaiah of Rhodes and Alexander of Diospolis,\n",
      "were dragged through the streets of Constantinople, while their brethren\n",
      "were admonished, by the voice of a crier, to observe this awful lesson,\n",
      "and not to pollute the sanctity of their character. Perhaps these\n",
      "prelates were innocent. A sentence of death and infamy was often founded\n",
      "on the slight and suspicious evidence of a child or a servant: the guilt\n",
      "of the green faction, of the rich, and of the enemies of Theodora, was\n",
      "presumed by the judges, and pÊderasty became the crime of those to whom\n",
      "no crime could be imputed. A French philosopher has dared to remark that\n",
      "whatever is secret must be doubtful, and that our natural horror of vice\n",
      "may be abused as an engine of tyranny. But the favorable persuasion of\n",
      "the same writer, that a legislator may confide in the taste and reason\n",
      "of mankind, is impeached by the unwelcome discovery of the antiquity and\n",
      "extent of the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "The free citizens of Athens and Rome enjoyed, in all criminal cases,\n",
      "the invaluable privilege of being tried by their country. 1. The\n",
      "administration of justice is the most ancient office of a prince: it was\n",
      "exercised by the Roman kings, and abused by Tarquin; who alone, without\n",
      "law or council, pronounced his arbitrary judgments. The first consuls\n",
      "succeeded to this regal prerogative; but the sacred right of appeal soon\n",
      "abolished the jurisdiction of the magistrates, and all public causes\n",
      "were decided by the supreme tribunal of the people. But a wild\n",
      "democracy, superior to the forms, too often disdains the essential\n",
      "principles, of justice: the pride of despotism was envenomed by plebeian\n",
      "envy, and the heroes of Athens might sometimes applaud the happiness of\n",
      "the Persian, whose fate depended on the caprice of a _single_ tyrant.\n",
      "Some salutary restraints, imposed by the people or their own passions,\n",
      "were at once the cause and effect of the gravity and temperance of the\n",
      "Romans. The right of accusation was confined to the magistrates. A vote\n",
      "of the thirty five tribes could inflict a fine; but the cognizance of\n",
      "all capital crimes was reserved by a fundamental law to the assembly of\n",
      "the centuries, in which the weight of influence and property was sure to\n",
      "preponderate. Repeated proclamations and adjournments were interposed,\n",
      "to allow time for prejudice and resentment to subside: the whole\n",
      "proceeding might be annulled by a seasonable omen, or the opposition\n",
      "of a tribune; and such popular trials were commonly less formidable\n",
      "to innocence than they were favorable to guilt. But this union of the\n",
      "judicial and legislative powers left it doubtful whether the accused\n",
      "party was pardoned or acquitted; and, in the defence of an illustrious\n",
      "client, the orators of Rome and Athens address their arguments to the\n",
      "policy and benevolence, as well as to the justice, of their sovereign.\n",
      "2. The task of convening the citizens for the trial of each offender\n",
      "became more difficult, as the citizens and the offenders continually\n",
      "multiplied; and the ready expedient was adopted of delegating\n",
      "the jurisdiction of the people to the ordinary magistrates, or to\n",
      "extraordinary _inquisitors_. In the first ages these questions were rare\n",
      "and occasional. In the beginning of the seventh century of Rome they\n",
      "were made perpetual: four prÊtors were annually empowered to sit in\n",
      "judgment on the state offences of treason, extortion, peculation, and\n",
      "bribery; and Sylla added new prÊtors and new questions for those\n",
      "crimes which more directly injure the safety of individuals. By these\n",
      "_inquisitors_ the trial was prepared and directed; but they could only\n",
      "pronounce the sentence of the majority of _judges_, who with some\n",
      "truth, and more prejudice, have been compared to the English juries. To\n",
      "discharge this important, though burdensome office, an annual list of\n",
      "ancient and respectable citizens was formed by the prÊtor. After many\n",
      "constitutional struggles, they were chosen in equal numbers from the\n",
      "senate, the equestrian order, and the people; four hundred and fifty\n",
      "were appointed for single questions; and the various rolls or _decuries_\n",
      "of judges must have contained the names of some thousand Romans, who\n",
      "represented the judicial authority of the state. In each particular\n",
      "cause, a sufficient number was drawn from the urn; their integrity was\n",
      "guarded by an oath; the mode of ballot secured their independence; the\n",
      "suspicion of partiality was removed by the mutual challenges of the\n",
      "accuser and defendant; and the judges of Milo, by the retrenchment of\n",
      "fifteen on each side, were reduced to fifty-one voices or tablets,\n",
      "of acquittal, of condemnation, or of favorable doubt. 3. In his civil\n",
      "jurisdiction, the prÊtor of the city was truly a judge, and almost a\n",
      "legislator; but, as soon as he had prescribed the action of law, he\n",
      "often referred to a delegate the determination of the fact. With the\n",
      "increase of legal proceedings, the tribunal of the centumvirs, in which\n",
      "he presided, acquired more weight and reputation. But whether he acted\n",
      "alone, or with the advice of his council, the most absolute powers might\n",
      "be trusted to a magistrate who was annually chosen by the votes of\n",
      "the people. The rules and precautions of freedom have required some\n",
      "explanation; the order of despotism is simple and inanimate. Before the\n",
      "age of Justinian, or perhaps of Diocletian, the decuries of Roman judges\n",
      "had sunk to an empty title: the humble advice of the assessors might\n",
      "be accepted or despised; and in each tribunal the civil and criminal\n",
      "jurisdiction was administered by a single magistrate, who was raised and\n",
      "disgraced by the will of the emperor.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Roman accused of any capital crime might prevent the sentence of\n",
      "the law by voluntary exile, or death. Till his guilt had been legally\n",
      "proved, his innocence was presumed, and his person was free: till the\n",
      "votes of the last _century_ had been counted and declared, he might\n",
      "peaceably secede to any of the allied cities of Italy, or Greece, or\n",
      "Asia. His fame and fortunes were preserved, at least to his children,\n",
      "by this civil death; and he might still be happy in every rational and\n",
      "sensual enjoyment, if a mind accustomed to the ambitious tumult of Rome\n",
      "could support the uniformity and silence of Rhodes or Athens. A bolder\n",
      "effort was required to escape from the tyranny of the CÊsars; but this\n",
      "effort was rendered familiar by the maxims of the stoics, the example of\n",
      "the bravest Romans, and the legal encouragements of suicide. The bodies\n",
      "of condemned criminals were exposed to public ignominy, and their\n",
      "children, a more serious evil, were reduced to poverty by the\n",
      "confiscation of their fortunes. But, if the victims of Tiberius and\n",
      "Nero anticipated the decree of the prince or senate, their courage and\n",
      "despatch were recompensed by the applause of the public, the decent\n",
      "honors of burial, and the validity of their testaments. The exquisite\n",
      "avarice and cruelty of Domitian appear to have deprived the unfortunate\n",
      "of this last consolation, and it was still denied even by the clemency\n",
      "of the Antonines. A voluntary death, which, in the case of a capital\n",
      "offence, intervened between the accusation and the sentence, was\n",
      "admitted as a confession of guilt, and the spoils of the deceased were\n",
      "seized by the inhuman claims of the treasury. Yet the civilians have\n",
      "always respected the natural right of a citizen to dispose of his life;\n",
      "and the posthumous disgrace invented by Tarquin, to check the despair of\n",
      "his subjects, was never revived or imitated by succeeding tyrants. The\n",
      "powers of this world have indeed lost their dominion over him who is\n",
      "resolved on death; and his arm can only be restrained by the religious\n",
      "apprehension of a future state. Suicides are enumerated by Virgil among\n",
      "the unfortunate, rather than the guilty; and the poetical fables of the\n",
      "infernal shades could not seriously influence the faith or practice of\n",
      "mankind. But the precepts of the gospel, or the church, have at length\n",
      "imposed a pious servitude on the minds of Christians, and condemn\n",
      "them to expect, without a murmur, the last stroke of disease or the\n",
      "executioner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The penal statutes form a very small proportion of the sixty-two books\n",
      "of the Code and Pandects; and in all judicial proceedings, the life or\n",
      "death of a citizen is determined with less caution or delay than\n",
      "the most ordinary question of covenant or inheritance. This singular\n",
      "distinction, though something may be allowed for the urgent necessity of\n",
      "defending the peace of society, is derived from the nature of criminal\n",
      "and civil jurisprudence. Our duties to the state are simple and uniform:\n",
      "the law by which he is condemned is inscribed not only on brass or\n",
      "marble, but on the conscience of the offender, and his guilt is commonly\n",
      "proved by the testimony of a single fact. But our relations to each\n",
      "other are various and infinite; our obligations are created,\n",
      "annulled, and modified, by injuries, benefits, and promises; and the\n",
      "interpretation of voluntary contracts and testaments, which are often\n",
      "dictated by fraud or ignorance, affords a long and laborious exercise\n",
      "to the sagacity of the judge. The business of life is multiplied by the\n",
      "extent of commerce and dominion, and the residence of the parties in\n",
      "the distant provinces of an empire is productive of doubt, delay, and\n",
      "inevitable appeals from the local to the supreme magistrate. Justinian,\n",
      "the Greek emperor of Constantinople and the East, was the legal\n",
      "successor of the Latin shepherd who had planted a colony on the banks\n",
      "of the Tyber. In a period of thirteen hundred years, the laws had\n",
      "reluctantly followed the changes of government and manners; and the\n",
      "laudable desire of conciliating ancient names with recent institutions\n",
      "destroyed the harmony, and swelled the magnitude, of the obscure and\n",
      "irregular system. The laws which excuse, on any occasions, the\n",
      "ignorance of their subjects, confess their own imperfections: the\n",
      "civil jurisprudence, as it was abridged by Justinian, still continued a\n",
      "mysterious science, and a profitable trade, and the innate perplexity\n",
      "of the study was involved in tenfold darkness by the private industry\n",
      "of the practitioners. The expense of the pursuit sometimes exceeded the\n",
      "value of the prize, and the fairest rights were abandoned by the poverty\n",
      "or prudence of the claimants. Such costly justice might tend to abate\n",
      "the spirit of litigation, but the unequal pressure serves only to\n",
      "increase the influence of the rich, and to aggravate the misery of the\n",
      "poor. By these dilatory and expensive proceedings, the wealthy pleader\n",
      "obtains a more certain advantage than he could hope from the accidental\n",
      "corruption of his judge. The experience of an abuse, from which our\n",
      "own age and country are not perfectly exempt, may sometimes provoke\n",
      "a generous indignation, and extort the hasty wish of exchanging our\n",
      "elaborate jurisprudence for the simple and summary decrees of a Turkish\n",
      "cadhi. Our calmer reflection will suggest, that such forms and delays\n",
      "are necessary to guard the person and property of the citizen; that the\n",
      "discretion of the judge is the first engine of tyranny; and that the\n",
      "laws of a free people should foresee and determine every question that\n",
      "may probably arise in the exercise of power and the transactions of\n",
      "industry. But the government of Justinian united the evils of liberty\n",

      "During the last years of Justinian, his infirm mind was devoted to\n",
      "heavenly contemplation, and he neglected the business of the lower\n",
      "world. His subjects were impatient of the long continuance of his life\n",
      "and reign: yet all who were capable of reflection apprehended the moment\n",
      "of his death, which might involve the capital in tumult, and the empire\n",
      "in civil war. Seven nephews of the childless monarch, the sons or\n",
      "grandsons of his brother and sister, had been educated in the splendor\n",
      "of a princely fortune; they had been shown in high commands to the\n",
      "provinces and armies; their characters were known, their followers were\n",
      "zealous, and, as the jealousy of age postponed the declaration of a\n",
      "successor, they might expect with equal hopes the inheritance of their\n",
      "uncle. He expired in his palace, after a reign of thirty-eight years;\n",
      "and the decisive opportunity was embraced by the friends of Justin, the\n",
      "son of Vigilantia. At the hour of midnight, his domestics were awakened\n",
      "by an importunate crowd, who thundered at his door, and obtained\n",
      "admittance by revealing themselves to be the principal members of the\n",
      "senate. These welcome deputies announced the recent and momentous secret\n",
      "of the emperor's decease; reported, or perhaps invented, his dying\n",
      "choice of the best beloved and most deserving of his nephews, and\n",
      "conjured Justin to prevent the disorders of the multitude, if they\n",
      "should perceive, with the return of light, that they were left without a\n",
      "master. After composing his countenance to surprise, sorrow, and decent\n",
      "modesty, Justin, by the advice of his wife Sophia, submitted to the\n",
      "authority of the senate. He was conducted with speed and silence to\n",
      "the palace; the guards saluted their new sovereign; and the martial and\n",
      "religious rites of his coronation were diligently accomplished. By the\n",
      "hands of the proper officers he was invested with the Imperial garments,\n",
      "the red buskins, white tunic, and purple robe. A fortunate soldier, whom\n",
      "he instantly promoted to the rank of tribune, encircled his neck with\n",
      "a military collar; four robust youths exalted him on a shield; he stood\n",
      "firm and erect to receive the adoration of his subjects; and their\n",
      "choice was sanctified by the benediction of the patriarch, who imposed\n",
      "the diadem on the head of an orthodox prince. The hippodrome was already\n",
      "filled with innumerable multitudes; and no sooner did the emperor appear\n",
      "on his throne, than the voices of the blue and the green factions were\n",
      "confounded in the same loyal acclamations. In the speeches which Justin\n",
      "addressed to the senate and people, he promised to correct the abuses\n",
      "which had disgraced the age of his predecessor, displayed the maxims of\n",
      "a just and beneficent government, and declared that, on the approaching\n",
      "calends of January, he would revive in his own person the name and\n",
      "liberty of a Roman consul. The immediate discharge of his uncle's\n",
      "debts exhibited a solid pledge of his faith and generosity: a train\n",
      "of porters, laden with bags of gold, advanced into the midst of the\n",
      "hippodrome, and the hopeless creditors of Justinian accepted this\n",
      "equitable payment as a voluntary gift. Before the end of three years,\n",
      "his example was imitated and surpassed by the empress Sophia, who\n",
      "delivered many indigent citizens from the weight of debt and usury: an\n",
      "act of benevolence the best entitled to gratitude, since it relieves the\n",
      "most intolerable distress; but in which the bounty of a prince is the\n",
      "most liable to be abused by the claims of prodigality and fraud.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the seventh day of his reign, Justin gave audience to the ambassadors\n",
      "of the Avars, and the scene was decorated to impress the Barbarians with\n",
      "astonishment, veneration, and terror. From the palace gate, the spacious\n",
      "courts and long porticos were lined with the lofty crests and gilt\n",
      "bucklers of the guards, who presented their spears and axes with more\n",
      "confidence than they would have shown in a field of battle. The officers\n",
      "who exercised the power, or attended the person, of the prince, were\n",
      "attired in their richest habits, and arranged according to the military\n",
      "and civil order of the hierarchy. When the veil of the sanctuary was\n",
      "withdrawn, the ambassadors beheld the emperor of the East on his throne,\n",
      "beneath a canopy, or dome, which was supported by four columns, and\n",
      "crowned with a winged figure of Victory. In the first emotions of\n",
      "surprise, they submitted to the servile adoration of the Byzantine\n",
      "court; but as soon as they rose from the ground, Targetius, the chief\n",
      "of the embassy, expressed the freedom and pride of a Barbarian. He\n",
      "extolled, by the tongue of his interpreter, the greatness of the chagan,\n",
      "by whose clemency the kingdoms of the South were permitted to exist,\n",
      "whose victorious subjects had traversed the frozen rivers of Scythia,\n",
      "and who now covered the banks of the Danube with innumerable tents.\n",
      "The late emperor had cultivated, with annual and costly gifts, the\n",
      "friendship of a grateful monarch, and the enemies of Rome had respected\n",
      "the allies of the Avars. The same prudence would instruct the nephew of\n",
      "Justinian to imitate the liberality of his uncle, and to purchase the\n",
      "blessings of peace from an invincible people, who delighted and excelled\n",
      "in the exercise of war. The reply of the emperor was delivered in the\n",
      "same strain of haughty defiance, and he derived his confidence from\n",
      "the God of the Christians, the ancient glory of Rome, and the recent\n",
      "triumphs of Justinian. \"The empire,\" said he, \"abounds with men and\n",
      "horses, and arms sufficient to defend our frontiers, and to chastise\n",
      "the Barbarians. You offer aid, you threaten hostilities: we despise your\n",
      "enmity and your aid. The conquerors of the Avars solicit our alliance;\n",
      "shall we dread their fugitives and exiles? The bounty of our uncle\n",
      "was granted to your misery, to your humble prayers. From us you shall\n",
      "receive a more important obligation, the knowledge of your own weakness.\n",
      "Retire from our presence; the lives of ambassadors are safe; and, if\n",
      "you return to implore our pardon, perhaps you will taste of our\n",
      "benevolence.\" On the report of his ambassadors, the chagan was awed\n",
      "by the apparent firmness of a Roman emperor of whose character and\n",
      "resources he was ignorant. Instead of executing his threats against\n",
      "the Eastern empire, he marched into the poor and savage countries of\n",
      "Germany, which were subject to the dominion of the Franks. After two\n",
      "doubtful battles, he consented to retire, and the Austrasian king\n",
      "relieve the distress of his camp with an immediate supply of corn and\n",
      "cattle. Such repeated disappointments had chilled the spirit of the\n",
      "Avars, and their power would have dissolved away in the Sarmatian\n",
      "desert, if the alliance of Alboin, king of the Lombards, had not given\n",
      "a new object to their arms, and a lasting settlement to their wearied\n",
      "fortunes.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Alboin served under his father's standard, he encountered in\n",
      "battle, and transpierced with his lance, the rival prince of the GepidÊ.\n",
      "The Lombards, who applauded such early prowess, requested his father,\n",
      "with unanimous acclamations, that the heroic youth, who had shared the\n",
      "dangers of the field, might be admitted to the feast of victory. \"You\n",
      "are not unmindful,\" replied the inflexible Audoin, \"of the wise customs\n",
      "of our ancestors. Whatever may be his merit, a prince is incapable of\n",
      "sitting at table with his father till he has received his arms from a\n",
      "foreign and royal hand.\" Alboin bowed with reverence to the institutions\n",
      "of his country, selected forty companions, and boldly visited the court\n",
      "of Turisund, king of the GepidÊ, who embraced and entertained, according\n",
      "to the laws of hospitality, the murderer of his son. At the banquet,\n",
      "whilst Alboin occupied the seat of the youth whom he had slain, a tender\n",
      "remembrance arose in the mind of Turisund. \"How dear is that place! how\n",
      "hateful is that person!\" were the words that escaped, with a sigh, from\n",
      "the indignant father. His grief exasperated the national resentment of\n",
      "the GepidÊ; and Cunimund, his surviving son, was provoked by wine, or\n",
      "fraternal affection, to the desire of vengeance. \"The Lombards,\" said\n",
      "the rude Barbarian, \"resemble, in figure and in smell, the mares of our\n",
      "Sarmatian plains.\" And this insult was a coarse allusion to the white\n",
      "bands which enveloped their legs. \"Add another resemblance,\" replied\n",
      "an audacious Lombard; \"you have felt how strongly they kick. Visit\n",
      "the plain of Asfield, and seek for the bones of thy brother: they are\n",
      "mingled with those of the vilest animals.\" The GepidÊ, a nation of\n",
      "warriors, started from their seats, and the fearless Alboin, with his\n",
      "forty companions, laid their hands on their swords. The tumult was\n",
      "appeased by the venerable interposition of Turisund. He saved his\n",
      "own honor, and the life of his guest; and, after the solemn rites of\n",
      "investiture, dismissed the stranger in the bloody arms of his son; the\n",
      "gift of a weeping parent. Alboin returned in triumph; and the Lombards,\n",
      "who celebrated his matchless intrepidity, were compelled to praise the\n",
      "virtues of an enemy. In this extraordinary visit he had probably seen\n",
      "the daughter of Cunimund, who soon after ascended the throne of the\n",
      "GepidÊ. Her name was Rosamond, an appellation expressive of female\n",
      "beauty, and which our own history or romance has consecrated to amorous\n",
      "tales. The king of the Lombards (the father of Alboin no longer lived)\n",
      "was contracted to the granddaughter of Clovis; but the restraints\n",
      "of faith and policy soon yielded to the hope of possessing the fair\n",
      "Rosamond, and of insulting her family and nation. The arts of persuasion\n",
      "were tried without success; and the impatient lover, by force and\n",
      "stratagem, obtained the object of his desires. War was the consequence\n",
      "which he foresaw and solicited; but the Lombards could not long\n",
      "withstand the furious assault of the GepidÊ, who were sustained by a\n",
      "Roman army. And, as the offer of marriage was rejected with contempt,\n",
      "Alboin was compelled to relinquish his prey, and to partake of the\n",
      "disgrace which he had inflicted on the house of Cunimund.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a public quarrel is envenomed by private injuries, a blow that is\n",
      "not mortal or decisive can be productive only of a short truce,\n",
      "which allows the unsuccessful combatant to sharpen his arms for a\n",
      "new encounter. The strength of Alboin had been found unequal to the\n",
      "gratification of his love, ambition, and revenge: he condescended to\n",
      "implore the formidable aid of the chagan; and the arguments that he\n",
      "employed are expressive of the art and policy of the Barbarians. In\n",
      "the attack of the GepidÊ, he had been prompted by the just desire of\n",
      "extirpating a people whom their alliance with the Roman empire had\n",
      "rendered the common enemies of the nations, and the personal adversaries\n",
      "of the chagan. If the forces of the Avars and the Lombards should\n",
      "unite in this glorious quarrel, the victory was secure, and the reward\n",
      "inestimable: the Danube, the Hebrus, Italy, and Constantinople, would\n",
      "be exposed, without a barrier, to their invincible arms. But, if they\n",
      "hesitated or delayed to prevent the malice of the Romans, the same\n",
      "spirit which had insulted would pursue the Avars to the extremity of the\n",
      "earth. These specious reasons were heard by the chagan with coldness and\n",
      "disdain: he detained the Lombard ambassadors in his camp, protracted the\n",
      "negotiation, and by turns alleged his want of inclination, or his\n",
      "want of ability, to undertake this important enterprise. At length he\n",
      "signified the ultimate price of his alliance, that the Lombards should\n",
      "immediately present him with a tithe of their cattle; that the spoils\n",
      "and captives should be equally divided; but that the lands of the GepidÊ\n",
      "should become the sole patrimony of the Avars. Such hard conditions\n",
      "were eagerly accepted by the passions of Alboin; and, as the Romans\n",
      "were dissatisfied with the ingratitude and perfidy of the GepidÊ, Justin\n",
      "abandoned that incorrigible people to their fate, and remained the\n",
      "tranquil spectator of this unequal conflict. The despair of Cunimund\n",
      "was active and dangerous. He was informed that the Avars had entered\n",
      "his confines; but, on the strong assurance that, after the defeat of\n",
      "the Lombards, these foreign invaders would easily be repelled, he rushed\n",
      "forwards to encounter the implacable enemy of his name and family. But\n",
      "the courage of the GepidÊ could secure them no more than an honorable\n",
      "death. The bravest of the nation fell in the field of battle; the king\n",
      "of the Lombards contemplated with delight the head of Cunimund; and his\n",
      "skull was fashioned into a cup to satiate the hatred of the conqueror,\n",
      "or, perhaps, to comply with the savage custom of his country. After\n",
      "this victory, no further obstacle could impede the progress of the\n",
      "confederates, and they faithfully executed the terms of their agreement.\n",
      "The fair countries of Walachia, Moldavia, Transylvania, and the other\n",
      "parts of Hungary beyond the Danube, were occupied, without resistance,\n",
      "by a new colony of Scythians; and the Dacian empire of the chagans\n",
      "subsisted with splendor above two hundred and thirty years. The nation\n",
      "of the GepidÊ was dissolved; but, in the distribution of the captives,\n",
      "the slaves of the Avars were less fortunate than the companions of the\n",
      "Lombards, whose generosity adopted a valiant foe, and whose freedom was\n",
      "incompatible with cool and deliberate tyranny. One moiety of the spoil\n",
      "introduced into the camp of Alboin more wealth than a Barbarian could\n",
      "readily compute. The fair Rosamond was persuaded, or compelled, to\n",
      "acknowledge the rights of her victorious lover; and the daughter of\n",
      "Cunimund appeared to forgive those crimes which might be imputed to her\n",
      "own irresistible charms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The destruction of a mighty kingdom established the fame of Alboin. In\n",
      "the days of Charlemagne, the Bavarians, the Saxons, and the other tribes\n",
      "of the Teutonic language, still repeated the songs which described the\n",
      "heroic virtues, the valor, liberality, and fortune of the king of the\n",
      "Lombards. But his ambition was yet unsatisfied; and the conqueror of the\n",
      "GepidÊ turned his eyes from the Danube to the richer banks of the Po,\n",
      "and the Tyber. Fifteen years had not elapsed, since his subjects, the\n",
      "confederates of Narses, had visited the pleasant climate of Italy: the\n",
      "mountains, the rivers, the highways, were familiar to their memory: the\n",
      "report of their success, perhaps the view of their spoils, had kindled\n",
      "in the rising generation the flame of emulation and enterprise. Their\n",
      "hopes were encouraged by the spirit and eloquence of Alboin: and it\n",
      "is affirmed, that he spoke to their senses, by producing at the royal\n",
      "feast, the fairest and most exquisite fruits that grew spontaneously in\n",
      "the garden of the world. No sooner had he erected his standard, than the\n",
      "native strength of the Lombard was multiplied by the adventurous youth\n",
      "of Germany and Scythia. The robust peasantry of Noricum and Pannonia\n",
      "had resumed the manners of Barbarians; and the names of the GepidÊ,\n",
      "Bulgarians, Sarmatians, and Bavarians, may be distinctly traced in\n",
      "the provinces of Italy. Of the Saxons, the old allies of the Lombards,\n",
      "twenty thousand warriors, with their wives and children, accepted the\n",
      "invitation of Alboin. Their bravery contributed to his success; but the\n",
      "accession or the absence of their numbers was not sensibly felt in the\n",
      "magnitude of his host. Every mode of religion was freely practised by\n",
      "its respective votaries. The king of the Lombards had been educated\n",
      "in the Arian heresy; but the Catholics, in their public worship, were\n",
      "allowed to pray for his conversion; while the more stubborn Barbarians\n",
      "sacrificed a she-goat, or perhaps a captive, to the gods of their\n",
      "fathers. The Lombards, and their confederates, were united by their\n",
      "common attachment to a chief, who excelled in all the virtues and vices\n",
      "of a savage hero; and the vigilance of Alboin provided an ample magazine\n",
      "of offensive and defensive arms for the use of the expedition. The\n",
      "portable wealth of the Lombards attended the march: their lands they\n",
      "cheerfully relinquished to the Avars, on the solemn promise, which was\n",
      "made and accepted without a smile, that if they failed in the conquest\n",
      "of Italy, these voluntary exiles should be reinstated in their former\n",
      "possessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "They might have failed, if Narses had been the antagonist of the\n",
      "Lombards; and the veteran warriors, the associates of his Gothic\n",
      "victory, would have encountered with reluctance an enemy whom they\n",
      "dreaded and esteemed. But the weakness of the Byzantine court was\n",
      "subservient to the Barbarian cause; and it was for the ruin of Italy,\n",
      "that the emperor once listened to the complaints of his subjects. The\n",
      "virtues of Narses were stained with avarice; and, in his provincial\n",
      "reign of fifteen years, he accumulated a treasure of gold and silver\n",
      "which surpassed the modesty of a private fortune. His government was\n",
      "oppressive or unpopular, and the general discontent was expressed with\n",
      "freedom by the deputies of Rome. Before the throne of Justinian they\n",
      "boldly declared, that their Gothic servitude had been more tolerable\n",
      "than the despotism of a Greek eunuch; and that, unless their tyrant were\n",
      "instantly removed, they would consult their own happiness in the choice\n",
      "of a master. The apprehension of a revolt was urged by the voice of\n",
      "envy and detraction, which had so recently triumphed over the merit\n",
      "of Belisarius. A new exarch, Longinus, was appointed to supersede the\n",
      "conqueror of Italy, and the base motives of his recall were revealed in\n",
      "the insulting mandate of the empress Sophia, \"that he should leave to\n",
      "_men_ the exercise of arms, and return to his proper station among the\n",
      "maidens of the palace, where a distaff should be again placed in the\n",
      "hand of the eunuch.\" \"I will spin her such a thread as she shall not\n",
      "easily unravel!\" is said to have been the reply which indignation and\n",
      "conscious virtue extorted from the hero. Instead of attending, a slave\n",
      "and a victim, at the gate of the Byzantine palace, he retired to Naples,\n",
      "from whence (if any credit is due to the belief of the times) Narses\n",
      "invited the Lombards to chastise the ingratitude of the prince and\n",
      "people. But the passions of the people are furious and changeable, and\n",
      "the Romans soon recollected the merits, or dreaded the resentment, of\n",
      "their victorious general. By the mediation of the pope, who undertook a\n",
      "special pilgrimage to Naples, their repentance was accepted; and Narses,\n",
      "assuming a milder aspect and a more dutiful language, consented to fix\n",
      "his residence in the Capitol. His death, though in the extreme period of\n",
      "old age, was unseasonable and premature, since _his_ genius alone could\n",
      "have repaired the last and fatal error of his life. The reality, or\n",
      "the suspicion, of a conspiracy disarmed and disunited the Italians. The\n",
      "soldiers resented the disgrace, and bewailed the loss, of their general.\n",
      "They were ignorant of their new exarch; and Longinus was himself\n",
      "ignorant of the state of the army and the province. In the preceding\n",
      "years Italy had been desolated by pestilence and famine, and a\n",
      "disaffected people ascribed the calamities of nature to the guilt or\n",
      "folly of their rulers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever might be the grounds of his security, Alboin neither expected\n",
      "nor encountered a Roman army in the field. He ascended the Julian Alps,\n",
      "and looked down with contempt and desire on the fruitful plains to\n",
      "which his victory communicated the perpetual appellation of Lombardy.\n",
      "A faithful chieftain, and a select band, were stationed at Forum Julii,\n",
      "the modern Friuli, to guard the passes of the mountains. The Lombards\n",
      "respected the strength of Pavia, and listened to the prayers of the\n",
      "Trevisans: their slow and heavy multitudes proceeded to occupy the\n",
      "palace and city of Verona; and Milan, now rising from her ashes, was\n",
      "invested by the powers of Alboin five months after his departure from\n",
      "Pannonia. Terror preceded his march: he found every where, or he left,\n",
      "a dreary solitude; and the pusillanimous Italians presumed, without a\n",
      "trial, that the stranger was invincible. Escaping to lakes, or rocks,\n",
      "or morasses, the affrighted crowds concealed some fragments of their\n",
      "wealth, and delayed the moment of their servitude. Paulinus, the\n",
      "patriarch of Aquileia, removed his treasures, sacred and profane, to the\n",
      "Isle of Grado, and his successors were adopted by the infant republic\n",
      "of Venice, which was continually enriched by the public calamities.\n",
      "Honoratus, who filled the chair of St. Ambrose, had credulously accepted\n",
      "the faithless offers of a capitulation; and the archbishop, with the\n",
      "clergy and nobles of Milan, were driven by the perfidy of Alboin to seek\n",
      "a refuge in the less accessible ramparts of Genoa. Along the maritime\n",
      "coast, the courage of the inhabitants was supported by the facility\n",
      "of supply, the hopes of relief, and the power of escape; but from the\n",
      "Trentine hills to the gates of Ravenna and Rome the inland regions of\n",
      "Italy became, without a battle or a siege, the lasting patrimony of the\n",
      "Lombards. The submission of the people invited the Barbarian to assume\n",
      "the character of a lawful sovereign, and the helpless exarch was\n",
      "confined to the office of announcing to the emperor Justin the rapid and\n",
      "irretrievable loss of his provinces and cities. One city, which had been\n",
      "diligently fortified by the Goths, resisted the arms of a new invader;\n",
      "and while Italy was subdued by the flying detachments of the Lombards,\n",
      "the royal camp was fixed above three years before the western gate\n",
      "of Ticinum, or Pavia. The same courage which obtains the esteem of\n",
      "a civilized enemy provokes the fury of a savage, and the impatient\n",
      "besieger had bound himself by a tremendous oath, that age, and sex, and\n",
      "dignity, should be confounded in a general massacre. The aid of famine\n",
      "at length enabled him to execute his bloody vow; but, as Alboin entered\n",
      "the gate, his horse stumbled, fell, and could not be raised from the\n",
      "ground. One of his attendants was prompted by compassion, or piety, to\n",
      "interpret this miraculous sign of the wrath of Heaven: the conqueror\n",
      "paused and relented; he sheathed his sword, and peacefully reposing\n",
      "himself in the palace of Theodoric, proclaimed to the trembling\n",
      "multitude that they should live and obey. Delighted with the situation\n",
      "of a city which was endeared to his pride by the difficulty of the\n",
      "purchase, the prince of the Lombards disdained the ancient glories of\n",
      "Milan; and Pavia, during some ages, was respected as the capital of the\n",
      "kingdom of Italy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reign of the founder was splendid and transient; and, before he\n",
      "could regulate his new conquests, Alboin fell a sacrifice to domestic\n",
      "treason and female revenge. In a palace near Verona, which had not\n",
      "been erected for the Barbarians, he feasted the companions of his arms;\n",
      "intoxication was the reward of valor, and the king himself was\n",
      "tempted by appetite, or vanity, to exceed the ordinary measure of\n",
      "his intemperance. After draining many capacious bowls of RhÊtian or\n",
      "Falernian wine, he called for the skull of Cunimund, the noblest and\n",
      "most precious ornament of his sideboard. The cup of victory was accepted\n",
      "with horrid applause by the circle of the Lombard chiefs. \"Fill it again\n",
      "with wine,\" exclaimed the inhuman conqueror, \"fill it to the brim: carry\n",
      "this goblet to the queen, and request in my name that she would rejoice\n",
      "with her father.\" In an agony of grief and rage, Rosamond had strength\n",
      "to utter, \"Let the will of my lord be obeyed!\" and, touching it with her\n",
      "lips, pronounced a silent imprecation, that the insult should be\n",
      "washed away in the blood of Alboin. Some indulgence might be due to the\n",
      "resentment of a daughter, if she had not already violated the duties of\n",
      "a wife. Implacable in her enmity, or inconstant in her love, the queen\n",
      "of Italy had stooped from the throne to the arms of a subject, and\n",
      "Helmichis, the king's armor-bearer, was the secret minister of her\n",
      "pleasure and revenge. Against the proposal of the murder, he could\n",
      "no longer urge the scruples of fidelity or gratitude; but Helmichis\n",
      "trembled when he revolved the danger as well as the guilt, when he\n",
      "recollected the matchless strength and intrepidity of a warrior whom he\n",
      "had so often attended in the field of battle. He pressed and obtained,\n",
      "that one of the bravest champions of the Lombards should be associated\n",
      "to the enterprise; but no more than a promise of secrecy could be\n",
      "drawn from the gallant Peredeus, and the mode of seduction employed by\n",
      "Rosamond betrays her shameless insensibility both to honor and love. She\n",
      "supplied the place of one of her female attendants who was beloved by\n",
      "Peredeus, and contrived some excuse for darkness and silence, till\n",
      "she could inform her companion that he had enjoyed the queen of the\n",
      "Lombards, and that his own death, or the death of Alboin, must be the\n",
      "consequence of such treasonable adultery. In this alternative he chose\n",
      "rather to be the accomplice than the victim of Rosamond, whose undaunted\n",
      "spirit was incapable of fear or remorse. She expected and soon found a\n",
      "favorable moment, when the king, oppressed with wine, had retired from\n",
      "the table to his afternoon slumbers. His faithless spouse was anxious\n",
      "for his health and repose: the gates of the palace were shut, the arms\n",
      "removed, the attendants dismissed, and Rosamond, after lulling him to\n",
      "rest by her tender caresses, unbolted the chamber door, and urged the\n",
      "reluctant conspirators to the instant execution of the deed. On the\n",
      "first alarm, the warrior started from his couch: his sword, which he\n",
      "attempted to draw, had been fastened to the scabbard by the hand of\n",
      "Rosamond; and a small stool, his only weapon, could not long protect him\n",
      "from the spears of the assassins. The daughter of Cunimund smiled in\n",
      "his fall: his body was buried under the staircase of the palace; and the\n",
      "grateful posterity of the Lombards revered the tomb and the memory of\n",
      "their victorious leader.\n",

      "The ambitious Rosamond aspired to reign in the name of her lover; the\n",
      "city and palace of Verona were awed by her power; and a faithful band of\n",
      "her native GepidÊ was prepared to applaud the revenge, and to second\n",
      "the wishes, of their sovereign. But the Lombard chiefs, who fled in the\n",
      "first moments of consternation and disorder, had resumed their courage\n",
      "and collected their powers; and the nation, instead of submitting to her\n",
      "reign, demanded, with unanimous cries, that justice should be executed\n",
      "on the guilty spouse and the murderers of their king. She sought a\n",
      "refuge among the enemies of her country; and a criminal who deserved the\n",
      "abhorrence of mankind was protected by the selfish policy of the exarch.\n",
      "With her daughter, the heiress of the Lombard throne, her two lovers,\n",
      "her trusty GepidÊ, and the spoils of the palace of Verona, Rosamond\n",
      "descended the Adige and the Po, and was transported by a Greek vessel to\n",
      "the safe harbor of Ravenna. Longinus beheld with delight the charms and\n",
      "the treasures of the widow of Alboin: her situation and her past conduct\n",
      "might justify the most licentious proposals; and she readily listened to\n",
      "the passion of a minister, who, even in the decline of the empire, was\n",
      "respected as the equal of kings. The death of a jealous lover was an\n",
      "easy and grateful sacrifice; and, as Helmichis issued from the bath, he\n",
      "received the deadly potion from the hand of his mistress. The taste of\n",
      "the liquor, its speedy operation, and his experience of the character of\n",
      "Rosamond, convinced him that he was poisoned: he pointed his dagger to\n",
      "her breast, compelled her to drain the remainder of the cup, and expired\n",
      "in a few minutes, with the consolation that she could not survive to\n",
      "enjoy the fruits of her wickedness. The daughter of Alboin and\n",
      "Rosamond, with the richest spoils of the Lombards, was embarked for\n",
      "Constantinople: the surprising strength of Peredeus amused and terrified\n",
      "the Imperial court: his blindness and revenge exhibited an imperfect\n",
      "copy of the adventures of Samson. By the free suffrage of the nation, in\n",
      "the assembly of Pavia, Clepho, one of their noblest chiefs, was elected\n",
      "as the successor of Alboin. Before the end of eighteen months, the\n",
      "throne was polluted by a second murder: Clepho was stabbed by the hand\n",
      "of a domestic; the regal office was suspended above ten years during the\n",
      "minority of his son Autharis; and Italy was divided and oppressed by a\n",
      "ducal aristocracy of thirty tyrants.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the nephew of Justinian ascended the throne, he proclaimed a new\n",
      "Êra of happiness and glory. The annals of the second Justin are marked\n",
      "with disgrace abroad and misery at home. In the West, the Roman empire\n",
      "was afflicted by the loss of Italy, the desolation of Africa, and the\n",
      "conquests of the Persians. Injustice prevailed both in the capital and\n",
      "the provinces: the rich trembled for their property, the poor for their\n",
      "safety, the ordinary magistrates were ignorant or venal, the occasional\n",
      "remedies appear to have been arbitrary and violent, and the complaints\n",
      "of the people could no longer be silenced by the splendid names of a\n",
      "legislator and a conqueror. The opinion which imputes to the prince all\n",
      "the calamities of his times may be countenanced by the historian as\n",
      "a serious truth or a salutary prejudice. Yet a candid suspicion will\n",
      "arise, that the sentiments of Justin were pure and benevolent, and that\n",
      "he might have filled his station without reproach, if the faculties of\n",
      "his mind had not been impaired by disease, which deprived the emperor of\n",
      "the use of his feet, and confined him to the palace, a stranger to the\n",
      "complaints of the people and the vices of the government. The tardy\n",
      "knowledge of his own impotence determined him to lay down the weight of\n",
      "the diadem; and, in the choice of a worthy substitute, he showed some\n",
      "symptoms of a discerning and even magnanimous spirit. The only son of\n",
      "Justin and Sophia died in his infancy; their daughter Arabia was\n",
      "the wife of Baduarius, superintendent of the palace, and afterwards\n",
      "commander of the Italian armies, who vainly aspired to confirm the\n",
      "rights of marriage by those of adoption. While the empire appeared an\n",
      "object of desire, Justin was accustomed to behold with jealousy and\n",
      "hatred his brothers and cousins, the rivals of his hopes; nor could\n",
      "he depend on the gratitude of those who would accept the purple as a\n",
      "restitution, rather than a gift. Of these competitors, one had been\n",
      "removed by exile, and afterwards by death; and the emperor himself had\n",
      "inflicted such cruel insults on another, that he must either dread his\n",
      "resentment or despise his patience. This domestic animosity was refined\n",
      "into a generous resolution of seeking a successor, not in his family,\n",
      "but in the republic; and the artful Sophia recommended Tiberius, his\n",
      "faithful captain of the guards, whose virtues and fortune the emperor\n",
      "might cherish as the fruit of his judicious choice. The ceremony of\n",
      "his elevation to the rank of CÊsar, or Augustus, was performed in the\n",
      "portico of the palace, in the presence of the patriarch and the senate.\n",
      "Justin collected the remaining strength of his mind and body; but the\n",
      "popular belief that his speech was inspired by the Deity betrays a very\n",
      "humble opinion both of the man and of the times. \"You behold,\" said the\n",
      "emperor, \"the ensigns of supreme power. You are about to receive them,\n",
      "not from my hand, but from the hand of God. Honor them, and from them\n",
      "you will derive honor. Respect the empress your mother: you are now her\n",
      "son; before, you were her servant. Delight not in blood; abstain from\n",
      "revenge; avoid those actions by which I have incurred the public\n",
      "hatred; and consult the experience, rather than the example, of your\n",
      "predecessor. As a man, I have sinned; as a sinner, even in this life, I\n",
      "have been severely punished: but these servants, (and we pointed to his\n",
      "ministers,) who have abused my confidence, and inflamed my passions,\n",
      "will appear with me before the tribunal of Christ. I have been dazzled\n",
      "by the splendor of the diadem: be thou wise and modest; remember what\n",
      "you have been, remember what you are. You see around us your slaves, and\n",
      "your children: with the authority, assume the tenderness, of a parent.\n",
      "Love your people like yourself; cultivate the affections, maintain the\n",
      "discipline, of the army; protect the fortunes of the rich, relieve\n",
      "the necessities of the poor.\" The assembly, in silence and in tears,\n",
      "applauded the counsels, and sympathized with the repentance, of their\n",
      "prince the patriarch rehearsed the prayers of the church; Tiberius\n",
      "received the diadem on his knees; and Justin, who in his abdication\n",
      "appeared most worthy to reign, addressed the new monarch in the\n",
      "following words: \"If you consent, I live; if you command, I die: may the\n",
      "God of heaven and earth infuse into your heart whatever I have neglected\n",
      "or forgotten.\" The four last years of the emperor Justin were passed\n",
      "in tranquil obscurity: his conscience was no longer tormented by the\n",
      "remembrance of those duties which he was incapable of discharging;\n",
      "and his choice was justified by the filial reverence and gratitude of\n",
      "Tiberius.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the virtues of Tiberius, his beauty (he was one of the tallest and\n",
      "most comely of the Romans) might introduce him to the favor of Sophia;\n",
      "and the widow of Justin was persuaded, that she should preserve her\n",
      "station and influence under the reign of a second and more youthful\n",
      "husband. But, if the ambitious candidate had been tempted to flatter and\n",
      "dissemble, it was no longer in his power to fulfil her expectations,\n",
      "or his own promise. The factions of the hippodrome demanded, with some\n",
      "impatience, the name of their new empress: both the people and Sophia\n",
      "were astonished by the proclamation of Anastasia, the secret, though\n",
      "lawful, wife of the emperor Tiberius. Whatever could alleviate the\n",
      "disappointment of Sophia, Imperial honors, a stately palace, a numerous\n",
      "household, was liberally bestowed by the piety of her adopted son; on\n",
      "solemn occasions he attended and consulted the widow of his benefactor;\n",
      "but her ambition disdained the vain semblance of royalty, and the\n",
      "respectful appellation of mother served to exasperate, rather than\n",
      "appease, the rage of an injured woman. While she accepted, and repaid\n",
      "with a courtly smile, the fair expressions of regard and confidence,\n",
      "a secret alliance was concluded between the dowager empress and her\n",
      "ancient enemies; and Justinian, the son of Germanus, was employed as the\n",
      "instrument of her revenge. The pride of the reigning house supported,\n",
      "with reluctance, the dominion of a stranger: the youth was deservedly\n",
      "popular; his name, after the death of Justin, had been mentioned by\n",
      "a tumultuous faction; and his own submissive offer of his head with a\n",
      "treasure of sixty thousand pounds, might be interpreted as an evidence\n",
      "of guilt, or at least of fear. Justinian received a free pardon, and the\n",
      "command of the eastern army. The Persian monarch fled before his arms;\n",
      "and the acclamations which accompanied his triumph declared him worthy\n",
      "of the purple. His artful patroness had chosen the month of the vintage,\n",
      "while the emperor, in a rural solitude, was permitted to enjoy the\n",
      "pleasures of a subject. On the first intelligence of her designs, he\n",
      "returned to Constantinople, and the conspiracy was suppressed by his\n",
      "presence and firmness. From the pomp and honors which she had abused,\n",
      "Sophia was reduced to a modest allowance: Tiberius dismissed her train,\n",
      "intercepted her correspondence, and committed to a faithful guard the\n",
      "custody of her person. But the services of Justinian were not considered\n",
      "by that excellent prince as an aggravation of his offences: after a mild\n",
      "reproof, his treason and ingratitude were forgiven; and it was commonly\n",
      "believed, that the emperor entertained some thoughts of contracting\n",
      "a double alliance with the rival of his throne. The voice of an angel\n",
      "(such a fable was propagated) might reveal to the emperor, that he\n",
      "should always triumph over his domestic foes; but Tiberius derived a\n",
      "firmer assurance from the innocence and generosity of his own mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the odious name of Tiberius, he assumed the more popular\n",
      "appellation of Constantine, and imitated the purer virtues of the\n",
      "Antonines. After recording the vice or folly of so many Roman princes,\n",
      "it is pleasing to repose, for a moment, on a character conspicuous\n",
      "by the qualities of humanity, justice, temperance, and fortitude; to\n",
      "contemplate a sovereign affable in his palace, pious in the church,\n",
      "impartial on the seat of judgment, and victorious, at least by his\n",
      "generals, in the Persian war. The most glorious trophy of his victory\n",
      "consisted in a multitude of captives, whom Tiberius entertained,\n",
      "redeemed, and dismissed to their native homes with the charitable spirit\n",
      "of a Christian hero. The merit or misfortunes of his own subjects had a\n",
      "dearer claim to his beneficence, and he measured his bounty not so\n",
      "much by their expectations as by his own dignity. This maxim, however\n",
      "dangerous in a trustee of the public wealth, was balanced by a principle\n",
      "of humanity and justice, which taught him to abhor, as of the basest\n",
      "alloy, the gold that was extracted from the tears of the people. For\n",
      "their relief, as often as they had suffered by natural or hostile\n",
      "calamities, he was impatient to remit the arrears of the past, or the\n",
      "demands of future taxes: he sternly rejected the servile offerings of\n",
      "his ministers, which were compensated by tenfold oppression; and the\n",
      "wise and equitable laws of Tiberius excited the praise and regret\n",
      "of succeeding times. Constantinople believed that the emperor had\n",
      "discovered a treasure: but his genuine treasure consisted in the\n",
      "practice of liberal economy, and the contempt of all vain and\n",
      "superfluous expense. The Romans of the East would have been happy, if\n",
      "the best gift of Heaven, a patriot king, had been confirmed as a proper\n",
      "and permanent blessing. But in less than four years after the death of\n",
      "Justin, his worthy successor sunk into a mortal disease, which left him\n",
      "only sufficient time to restore the diadem, according to the tenure\n",
      "by which he held it, to the most deserving of his fellow-citizens.\n",
      "He selected Maurice from the crowd, a judgment more precious than the\n",
      "purple itself: the patriarch and senate were summoned to the bed of\n",
      "the dying prince: he bestowed his daughter and the empire; and his last\n",
      "advice was solemnly delivered by the voice of the quÊstor. Tiberius\n",
      "expressed his hope that the virtues of his son and successor would erect\n",
      "the noblest mausoleum to his memory. His memory was embalmed by the\n",
      "public affliction; but the most sincere grief evaporates in the tumult\n",
      "of a new reign, and the eyes and acclamations of mankind were speedily\n",
      "directed to the rising sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "The emperor Maurice derived his origin from ancient Rome; but his\n",
      "immediate parents were settled at Arabissus in Cappadocia, and their\n",
      "singular felicity preserved them alive to behold and partake the fortune\n",
      "of their august son. The youth of Maurice was spent in the profession of\n",
      "arms: Tiberius promoted him to the command of a new and favorite legion\n",
      "of twelve thousand confederates; his valor and conduct were signalized\n",
      "in the Persian war; and he returned to Constantinople to accept, as his\n",
      "just reward, the inheritance of the empire. Maurice ascended the throne\n",
      "at the mature age of forty-three years; and he reigned above twenty\n",
      "years over the East and over himself; expelling from his mind the\n",
      "wild democracy of passions, and establishing (according to the quaint\n",
      "expression of Evagrius) a perfect aristocracy of reason and virtue. Some\n",
      "suspicion will degrade the testimony of a subject, though he protests\n",
      "that his secret praise should never reach the ear of his sovereign, and\n",
      "some failings seem to place the character of Maurice below the purer\n",
      "merit of his predecessor. His cold and reserved demeanor might be\n",
      "imputed to arrogance; his justice was not always exempt from cruelty,\n",
      "nor his clemency from weakness; and his rigid economy too often exposed\n",
      "him to the reproach of avarice. But the rational wishes of an absolute\n",
      "monarch must tend to the happiness of his people. Maurice was endowed\n",
      "with sense and courage to promote that happiness, and his administration\n",
      "was directed by the principles and example of Tiberius. The\n",
      "pusillanimity of the Greeks had introduced so complete a separation\n",
      "between the offices of king and of general, that a private soldier, who\n",
      "had deserved and obtained the purple, seldom or never appeared at\n",
      "the head of his armies. Yet the emperor Maurice enjoyed the glory of\n",
      "restoring the Persian monarch to his throne; his lieutenants waged a\n",
      "doubtful war against the Avars of the Danube; and he cast an eye of\n",
      "pity, of ineffectual pity, on the abject and distressful state of his\n",
      "Italian provinces.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Italy the emperors were incessantly tormented by tales of misery\n",
      "and demands of succor, which extorted the humiliating confession of\n",
      "their own weakness. The expiring dignity of Rome was only marked by the\n",
      "freedom and energy of her complaints: \"If you are incapable,\" she said,\n",
      "\"of delivering us from the sword of the Lombards, save us at least from\n",
      "the calamity of famine.\" Tiberius forgave the reproach, and relieved the\n",
      "distress: a supply of corn was transported from Egypt to the Tyber; and\n",
      "the Roman people, invoking the name, not of Camillus, but of St. Peter\n",
      "repulsed the Barbarians from their walls. But the relief was accidental,\n",
      "the danger was perpetual and pressing; and the clergy and senate,\n",
      "collecting the remains of their ancient opulence, a sum of three\n",
      "thousand pounds of gold, despatched the patrician Pamphronius to lay\n",
      "their gifts and their complaints at the foot of the Byzantine throne.\n",
      "The attention of the court, and the forces of the East, were diverted by\n",
      "the Persian war: but the justice of Tiberius applied the subsidy to\n",
      "the defence of the city; and he dismissed the patrician with his best\n",
      "advice, either to bribe the Lombard chiefs, or to purchase the aid of\n",
      "the kings of France. Notwithstanding this weak invention, Italy was\n",
      "still afflicted, Rome was again besieged, and the suburb of Classe, only\n",
      "three miles from Ravenna, was pillaged and occupied by the troops of a\n",
      "simple duke of Spoleto. Maurice gave audience to a second deputation\n",
      "of priests and senators: the duties and the menaces of religion were\n",
      "forcibly urged in the letters of the Roman pontiff; and his nuncio,\n",
      "the deacon Gregory, was alike qualified to solicit the powers either of\n",
      "heaven or of the earth. The emperor adopted, with stronger effect, the\n",
      "measures of his predecessor: some formidable chiefs were persuaded\n",
      "to embrace the friendship of the Romans; and one of them, a mild and\n",
      "faithful Barbarian, lived and died in the service of the exarchs: the\n",
      "passes of the Alps were delivered to the Franks; and the pope encouraged\n",
      "them to violate, without scruple, their oaths and engagements to the\n",
      "misbelievers. Childebert, the great-grandson of Clovis, was persuaded\n",
      "to invade Italy by the payment of fifty thousand pieces; but, as he had\n",
      "viewed with delight some Byzantine coin of the weight of one pound of\n",
      "gold, the king of Austrasia might stipulate, that the gift should be\n",
      "rendered more worthy of his acceptance, by a proper mixture of these\n",
      "respectable medals. The dukes of the Lombards had provoked by frequent\n",
      "inroads their powerful neighbors of Gaul. As soon as they were\n",
      "apprehensive of a just retaliation, they renounced their feeble and\n",
      "disorderly independence: the advantages of real government, union,\n",
      "secrecy, and vigor, were unanimously confessed; and Autharis, the son of\n",
      "Clepho, had already attained the strength and reputation of a warrior.\n",
      "Under the standard of their new king, the conquerors of Italy withstood\n",
      "three successive invasions, one of which was led by Childebert himself,\n",
      "the last of the Merovingian race who descended from the Alps. The first\n",
      "expedition was defeated by the jealous animosity of the Franks and\n",
      "Alemanni. In the second they were vanquished in a bloody battle, with\n",
      "more loss and dishonor than they had sustained since the foundation of\n",
      "their monarchy. Impatient for revenge, they returned a third time with\n",
      "accumulated force, and Autharis yielded to the fury of the torrent.\n",
      "The troops and treasures of the Lombards were distributed in the walled\n",
      "towns between the Alps and the Apennine. A nation, less sensible of\n",
      "danger than of fatigue and delay, soon murmured against the folly of\n",
      "their twenty commanders; and the hot vapors of an Italian sun infected\n",
      "with disease those tramontane bodies which had already suffered the\n",
      "vicissitudes of intemperance and famine. The powers that were inadequate\n",
      "to the conquest, were more than sufficient for the desolation, of the\n",
      "country; nor could the trembling natives distinguish between their\n",
      "enemies and their deliverers. If the junction of the Merovingian and\n",
      "Imperial forces had been effected in the neighborhood of Milan, perhaps\n",
      "they might have subverted the throne of the Lombards; but the Franks\n",
      "expected six days the signal of a flaming village, and the arms of the\n",
      "Greeks were idly employed in the reduction of Modena and Parma, which\n",
      "were torn from them after the retreat of their transalpine allies. The\n",
      "victorious Autharis asserted his claim to the dominion of Italy. At\n",
      "the foot of the RhÊtian Alps, he subdued the resistance, and rifled the\n",
      "hidden treasures, of a sequestered island in the Lake of Comum. At the\n",
      "extreme point of the Calabria, he touched with his spear a column on\n",
      "the sea-shore of Rhegium, proclaiming that ancient landmark to stand the\n",
      "immovable boundary of his kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "During a period of two hundred years, Italy was unequally divided\n",
      "between the kingdom of the Lombards and the exarchate of Ravenna.\n",
      "The offices and professions, which the jealousy of Constantine had\n",
      "separated, were united by the indulgence of Justinian; and eighteen\n",
      "successive exarchs were invested, in the decline of the empire, with the\n",
      "full remains of civil, of military, and even of ecclesiastical, power.\n",
      "Their immediate jurisdiction, which was afterwards consecrated as the\n",
      "patrimony of St. Peter, extended over the modern Romagna, the marshes\n",
      "or valleys of Ferrara and Commachio, five maritime cities from Rimini to\n",
      "Ancona, and a second inland Pentapolis, between the Adriatic coast and\n",
      "the hills of the Apennine. Three subordinate provinces, of Rome, of\n",
      "Venice, and of Naples, which were divided by hostile lands from the\n",
      "palace of Ravenna, acknowledged, both in peace and war, the supremacy\n",
      "of the exarch. The duchy of Rome appears to have included the Tuscan,\n",
      "Sabine, and Latin conquests, of the first four hundred years of the\n",
      "city, and the limits may be distinctly traced along the coast, from\n",
      "Civita Vecchia to Terracina, and with the course of the Tyber from\n",
      "Ameria and Narni to the port of Ostia. The numerous islands from\n",
      "Grado to Chiozza composed the infant dominion of Venice: but the more\n",
      "accessible towns on the Continent were overthrown by the Lombards, who\n",
      "beheld with impotent fury a new capital rising from the waves. The power\n",
      "of the dukes of Naples was circumscribed by the bay and the adjacent\n",
      "isles, by the hostile territory of Capua, and by the Roman colony of\n",
      "Amalphi, whose industrious citizens, by the invention of the mariner's\n",
      "compass, have unveiled the face of the globe. The three islands of\n",
      "Sardinia, Corsica, and Sicily, still adhered to the empire; and the\n",
      "acquisition of the farther Calabria removed the landmark of Autharis\n",
      "from the shore of Rhegium to the Isthmus of Consentia. In Sardinia,\n",
      "the savage mountaineers preserved the liberty and religion of their\n",
      "ancestors; and the husbandmen of Sicily were chained to their rich and\n",
      "cultivated soil. Rome was oppressed by the iron sceptre of the exarchs,\n",
      "and a Greek, perhaps a eunuch, insulted with impunity the ruins of the\n",
      "Capitol. But Naples soon acquired the privilege of electing her own\n",
      "dukes: the independence of Amalphi was the fruit of commerce; and the\n",
      "voluntary attachment of Venice was finally ennobled by an equal alliance\n",
      "with the Eastern empire. On the map of Italy, the measure of the\n",
      "exarchate occupies a very inadequate space, but it included an ample\n",
      "proportion of wealth, industry, and population. The most faithful and\n",
      "valuable subjects escaped from the Barbarian yoke; and the banners of\n",
      "Pavia and Verona, of Milan and Padua, were displayed in their respective\n",
      "quarters by the new inhabitants of Ravenna. The remainder of Italy was\n",
      "possessed by the Lombards; and from Pavia, the royal seat, their\n",
      "kingdom was extended to the east, the north, and the west, as far as the\n",
      "confines of the Avars, the Bavarians, and the Franks of Austrasia and\n",
      "Burgundy. In the language of modern geography, it is now represented by\n",
      "the Terra Firma of the Venetian republic, Tyrol, the Milanese, Piedmont,\n",
      "the coast of Genoa, Mantua, Parma, and Modena, the grand duchy of\n",
      "Tuscany, and a large portion of the ecclesiastical state from Perugia\n",
      "to the Adriatic. The dukes, and at length the princes, of Beneventum,\n",
      "survived the monarchy, and propagated the name of the Lombards. From\n",
      "Capua to Tarentum, they reigned near five hundred years over the\n",
      "greatest part of the present kingdom of Naples.\n",
      "\n",
      "In comparing the proportion of the victorious and the vanquished\n",
      "people, the change of language will afford the most probably inference.\n",
      "According to this standard, it will appear, that the Lombards of Italy,\n",
      "and the Visigoths of Spain, were less numerous than the Franks or\n",
      "Burgundians; and the conquerors of Gaul must yield, in their turn, to\n",
      "the multitude of Saxons and Angles who almost eradicated the idioms of\n",
      "Britain. The modern Italian has been insensibly formed by the mixture\n",
      "of nations: the awkwardness of the Barbarians in the nice management\n",
      "of declensions and conjugations reduced them to the use of articles\n",
      "and auxiliary verbs; and many new ideas have been expressed by Teutonic\n",
      "appellations. Yet the principal stock of technical and familiar words is\n",
      "found to be of Latin derivation; and, if we were sufficiently conversant\n",
      "with the obsolete, the rustic, and the municipal dialects of ancient\n",
      "Italy, we should trace the origin of many terms which might, perhaps, be\n",
      "rejected by the classic purity of Rome. A numerous army constitutes but\n",
      "a small nation, and the powers of the Lombards were soon diminished\n",
      "by the retreat of twenty thousand Saxons, who scorned a dependent\n",
      "situation, and returned, after many bold and perilous adventures, to\n",
      "their native country. The camp of Alboin was of formidable extent, but\n",
      "the extent of a camp would be easily circumscribed within the limits of\n",
      "a city; and its martial in habitants must be thinly scattered over\n",
      "the face of a large country. When Alboin descended from the Alps, he\n",
      "invested his nephew, the first duke of Friuli, with the command of the\n",
      "province and the people: but the prudent Gisulf would have declined\n",
      "the dangerous office, unless he had been permitted to choose, among\n",
      "the nobles of the Lombards, a sufficient number of families to form a\n",
      "perpetual colony of soldiers and subjects. In the progress of conquest,\n",
      "the same option could not be granted to the dukes of Brescia or Bergamo,\n",
      "of Pavia or Turin, of Spoleto or Beneventum; but each of these, and each\n",
      "of their colleagues, settled in his appointed district with a band of\n",
      "followers who resorted to his standard in war and his tribunal in\n",
      "peace. Their attachment was free and honorable: resigning the gifts\n",
      "and benefits which they had accepted, they might emigrate with their\n",
      "families into the jurisdiction of another duke; but their absence from\n",
      "the kingdom was punished with death, as a crime of military desertion.\n",
      "The posterity of the first conquerors struck a deeper root into the\n",
      "soil, which, by every motive of interest and honor, they were bound to\n",
      "defend. A Lombard was born the soldier of his king and his duke; and the\n",
      "civil assemblies of the nation displayed the banners, and assumed the\n",
      "appellation, of a regular army. Of this army, the pay and the rewards\n",
      "were drawn from the conquered provinces; and the distribution, which was\n",
      "not effected till after the death of Alboin, is disgraced by the foul\n",
      "marks of injustice and rapine. Many of the most wealthy Italians were\n",
      "slain or banished; the remainder were divided among the strangers, and\n",
      "a tributary obligation was imposed (under the name of hospitality) of\n",
      "paying to the Lombards a third part of the fruits of the earth. Within\n",
      "less than seventy years, this artificial system was abolished by a more\n",
      "simple and solid tenure. Either the Roman landlord was expelled by\n",
      "his strong and insolent guest, or the annual payment, a third of the\n",
      "produce, was exchanged by a more equitable transaction for an adequate\n",
      "proportion of landed property. Under these foreign masters, the business\n",
      "of agriculture, in the cultivation of corn, wines, and olives, was\n",
      "exercised with degenerate skill and industry by the labor of the slaves\n",
      "and natives. But the occupations of a pastoral life were more pleasing\n",
      "to the idleness of the Barbarian. In the rich meadows of Venetia, they\n",
      "restored and improved the breed of horses, for which that province\n",
      "had once been illustrious; and the Italians beheld with astonishment a\n",
      "foreign race of oxen or buffaloes. The depopulation of Lombardy, and the\n",
      "increase of forests, afforded an ample range for the pleasures of\n",
      "the chase. That marvellous art which teaches the birds of the air to\n",
      "acknowledge the voice, and execute the commands, of their master, had\n",
      "been unknown to the ingenuity of the Greeks and Romans. Scandinavia and\n",
      "Scythia produce the boldest and most tractable falcons: they were tamed\n",
      "and educated by the roving inhabitants, always on horseback and in the\n",
      "field. This favorite amusement of our ancestors was introduced by the\n",
      "Barbarians into the Roman provinces; and the laws of Italy esteemed the\n",
      "sword and the hawk as of equal dignity and importance in the hands of a\n",
      "noble Lombard.\n",

      "Chapter XLV: State Of Italy Under The Lombards.--Part III.\n",
      "\n",
      "So rapid was the influence of climate and example, that the Lombards of\n",
      "the fourth generation surveyed with curiosity and affright the portraits\n",
      "of their savage forefathers. Their heads were shaven behind, but\n",
      "the shaggy locks hung over their eyes and mouth, and a long beard\n",
      "represented the name and character of the nation. Their dress consisted\n",
      "of loose linen garments, after the fashion of the Anglo-Saxons, which\n",
      "were decorated, in their opinion, with broad stripes or variegated\n",
      "colors. The legs and feet were clothed in long hose, and open sandals;\n",
      "and even in the security of peace a trusty sword was constantly girt to\n",
      "their side. Yet this strange apparel, and horrid aspect, often concealed\n",
      "a gentle and generous disposition; and as soon as the rage of battle\n",
      "had subsided, the captives and subjects were sometimes surprised by the\n",
      "humanity of the victor. The vices of the Lombards were the effect of\n",
      "passion, of ignorance, of intoxication; their virtues are the more\n",
      "laudable, as they were not affected by the hypocrisy of social manners,\n",
      "nor imposed by the rigid constraint of laws and education. I should not\n",
      "be apprehensive of deviating from my subject, if it were in my power\n",
      "to delineate the private life of the conquerors of Italy; and I shall\n",
      "relate with pleasure the adventurous gallantry of Autharis, which\n",
      "breathes the true spirit of chivalry and romance. After the loss of\n",
      "his promised bride, a Merovingian princess, he sought in marriage the\n",
      "daughter of the king of Bavaria; and Garribald accepted the alliance of\n",
      "the Italian monarch. Impatient of the slow progress of negotiation, the\n",
      "ardent lover escaped from his palace, and visited the court of Bavaria\n",
      "in the train of his own embassy. At the public audience, the unknown\n",
      "stranger advanced to the throne, and informed Garribald that the\n",
      "ambassador was indeed the minister of state, but that he alone was the\n",
      "friend of Autharis, who had trusted him with the delicate commission of\n",
      "making a faithful report of the charms of his spouse. Theudelinda was\n",
      "summoned to undergo this important examination; and, after a pause\n",
      "of silent rapture, he hailed her as the queen of Italy, and humbly\n",
      "requested that, according to the custom of the nation, she would present\n",
      "a cup of wine to the first of her new subjects. By the command of\n",
      "her father she obeyed: Autharis received the cup in his turn, and, in\n",
      "restoring it to the princess, he secretly touched her hand, and drew his\n",
      "own finger over his face and lips. In the evening, Theudelinda imparted\n",
      "to her nurse the indiscreet familiarity of the stranger, and was\n",
      "comforted by the assurance, that such boldness could proceed only from\n",
      "the king her husband, who, by his beauty and courage, appeared worthy of\n",
      "her love. The ambassadors were dismissed: no sooner did they reach the\n",
      "confines of Italy than Autharis, raising himself on his horse, darted\n",
      "his battle-axe against a tree with incomparable strength and dexterity.\n",
      "\"Such,\" said he to the astonished Bavarians, \"such are the strokes of\n",
      "the king of the Lombards.\" On the approach of a French army, Garribald\n",
      "and his daughter took refuge in the dominions of their ally; and the\n",
      "marriage was consummated in the palace of Verona. At the end of one\n",
      "year, it was dissolved by the death of Autharis: but the virtues of\n",
      "Theudelinda had endeared her to the nation, and she was permitted to\n",
      "bestow, with her hand, the sceptre of the Italian kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this fact, as well as from similar events, it is certain that\n",
      "the Lombards possessed freedom to elect their sovereign, and sense to\n",
      "decline the frequent use of that dangerous privilege. The public revenue\n",
      "arose from the produce of land and the profits of justice. When the\n",
      "independent dukes agreed that Autharis should ascend the throne of\n",
      "his father, they endowed the regal office with a fair moiety of their\n",
      "respective domains. The proudest nobles aspired to the honors of\n",
      "servitude near the person of their prince: he rewarded the fidelity\n",
      "of his vassals by the precarious gift of pensions and _benefices_; and\n",
      "atoned for the injuries of war by the rich foundation of monasteries and\n",
      "churches. In peace a judge, a leader in war, he never usurped the\n",
      "powers of a sole and absolute legislator. The king of Italy convened the\n",
      "national assemblies in the palace, or more probably in the fields, of\n",
      "Pavia: his great council was composed of the persons most eminent by\n",
      "their birth and dignities; but the validity, as well as the execution,\n",
      "of their decrees depended on the approbation of the _faithful_ people,\n",
      "the _fortunate_ army of the Lombards. About fourscore years after\n",
      "the conquest of Italy, their traditional customs were transcribed in\n",
      "Teutonic Latin, and ratified by the consent of the prince and people:\n",
      "some new regulations were introduced, more suitable to their present\n",
      "condition; the example of Rotharis was imitated by the wisest of his\n",
      "successors; and the laws of the Lombards have been esteemed the\n",
      "least imperfect of the Barbaric codes. Secure by their courage in the\n",
      "possession of liberty, these rude and hasty legislators were incapable\n",
      "of balancing the powers of the constitution, or of discussing the nice\n",
      "theory of political government. Such crimes as threatened the life\n",
      "of the sovereign, or the safety of the state, were adjudged worthy of\n",
      "death; but their attention was principally confined to the defence\n",
      "of the person and property of the subject. According to the strange\n",
      "jurisprudence of the times, the guilt of blood might be redeemed by a\n",
      "fine; yet the high price of nine hundred pieces of gold declares a\n",
      "just sense of the value of a simple citizen. Less atrocious injuries,\n",
      "a wound, a fracture, a blow, an opprobrious word, were measured with\n",
      "scrupulous and almost ridiculous diligence; and the prudence of the\n",
      "legislator encouraged the ignoble practice of bartering honor and\n",
      "revenge for a pecuniary compensation. The ignorance of the Lombards in\n",
      "the state of Paganism or Christianity gave implicit credit to the malice\n",
      "and mischief of witchcraft, but the judges of the seventeenth century\n",
      "might have been instructed and confounded by the wisdom of Rotharis, who\n",
      "derides the absurd superstition, and protects the wretched victims of\n",
      "popular or judicial cruelty. The same spirit of a legislator, superior\n",
      "to his age and country, may be ascribed to Luitprand, who condemns,\n",
      "while he tolerates, the impious and inveterate abuse of duels,\n",
      "observing, from his own experience, that the juster cause had often been\n",
      "oppressed by successful violence. Whatever merit may be discovered in\n",
      "the laws of the Lombards, they are the genuine fruit of the reason of\n",
      "the Barbarians, who never admitted the bishops of Italy to a seat in\n",
      "their legislative councils. But the succession of their kings is marked\n",
      "with virtue and ability; the troubled series of their annals is adorned\n",
      "with fair intervals of peace, order, and domestic happiness; and the\n",
      "Italians enjoyed a milder and more equitable government, than any of\n",
      "the other kingdoms which had been founded on the ruins of the Western\n",
      "empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amidst the arms of the Lombards, and under the despotism of the Greeks,\n",
      "we again inquire into the fate of Rome, which had reached, about the\n",
      "close of the sixth century, the lowest period of her depression. By the\n",
      "removal of the seat of empire, and the successive loss of the provinces,\n",
      "the sources of public and private opulence were exhausted: the lofty\n",
      "tree, under whose shade the nations of the earth had reposed, was\n",
      "deprived of its leaves and branches, and the sapless trunk was left to\n",
      "wither on the ground. The ministers of command, and the messengers of\n",
      "victory, no longer met on the Appian or Flaminian way; and the hostile\n",
      "approach of the Lombards was often felt, and continually feared. The\n",
      "inhabitants of a potent and peaceful capital, who visit without an\n",
      "anxious thought the garden of the adjacent country, will faintly picture\n",
      "in their fancy the distress of the Romans: they shut or opened their\n",
      "gates with a trembling hand, beheld from the walls the flames of their\n",
      "houses, and heard the lamentations of their brethren, who were coupled\n",
      "together like dogs, and dragged away into distant slavery beyond the sea\n",
      "and the mountains. Such incessant alarms must annihilate the pleasures\n",
      "and interrupt the labors of a rural life; and the Campagna of Rome was\n",
      "speedily reduced to the state of a dreary wilderness, in which the land\n",
      "is barren, the waters are impure, and the air is infectious. Curiosity\n",
      "and ambition no longer attracted the nations to the capital of the\n",
      "world: but, if chance or necessity directed the steps of a wandering\n",
      "stranger, he contemplated with horror the vacancy and solitude of the\n",
      "city, and might be tempted to ask, Where is the senate, and where are\n",
      "the people? In a season of excessive rains, the Tyber swelled above its\n",
      "banks, and rushed with irresistible violence into the valleys of the\n",
      "seven hills. A pestilential disease arose from the stagnation of the\n",
      "deluge, and so rapid was the contagion, that fourscore persons expired\n",
      "in an hour in the midst of a solemn procession, which implored the\n",
      "mercy of Heaven. A society in which marriage is encouraged and industry\n",
      "prevails soon repairs the accidental losses of pestilence and war:\n",
      "but, as the far greater part of the Romans was condemned to hopeless\n",
      "indigence and celibacy, the depopulation was constant and visible, and\n",
      "the gloomy enthusiasts might expect the approaching failure of the\n",
      "human race. Yet the number of citizens still exceeded the measure of\n",
      "subsistence: their precarious food was supplied from the harvests of\n",
      "Sicily or Egypt; and the frequent repetition of famine betrays the\n",
      "inattention of the emperor to a distant province. The edifices of Rome\n",
      "were exposed to the same ruin and decay: the mouldering fabrics were\n",
      "easily overthrown by inundations, tempests, and earthquakes: and the\n",
      "monks, who had occupied the most advantageous stations, exulted in their\n",
      "base triumph over the ruins of antiquity. It is commonly believed, that\n",
      "Pope Gregory the First attacked the temples and mutilated the statues\n",
      "of the city; that, by the command of the Barbarian, the Palatine library\n",
      "was reduced to ashes, and that the history of Livy was the peculiar\n",
      "mark of his absurd and mischievous fanaticism. The writings of Gregory\n",
      "himself reveal his implacable aversion to the monuments of classic\n",
      "genius; and he points his severest censure against the profane learning\n",
      "of a bishop, who taught the art of grammar, studied the Latin poets,\n",
      "and pronounced with the same voice the praises of Jupiter and those of\n",
      "Christ. But the evidence of his destructive rage is doubtful and recent:\n",
      "the Temple of Peace, or the theatre of Marcellus, have been demolished\n",
      "by the slow operation of ages, and a formal proscription would have\n",
      "multiplied the copies of Virgil and Livy in the countries which were not\n",
      "subject to the ecclesiastical dictator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Thebes, or Babylon, or Carthage, the names of Rome might have been\n",
      "erased from the earth, if the city had not been animated by a vital\n",
      "principle, which again restored her to honor and dominion. A vague\n",
      "tradition was embraced, that two Jewish teachers, a tent-maker and a\n",
      "fisherman, had formerly been executed in the circus of Nero, and at\n",
      "the end of five hundred years, their genuine or fictitious relics were\n",
      "adored as the Palladium of Christian Rome. The pilgrims of the East and\n",
      "West resorted to the holy threshold; but the shrines of the apostles\n",
      "were guarded by miracles and invisible terrors; and it was not without\n",
      "fear that the pious Catholic approached the object of his worship.\n",
      "It was fatal to touch, it was dangerous to behold, the bodies of the\n",
      "saints; and those who, from the purest motives, presumed to disturb the\n",
      "repose of the sanctuary, were affrighted by visions, or punished with\n",
      "sudden death. The unreasonable request of an empress, who wished to\n",
      "deprive the Romans of their sacred treasure, the head of St. Paul,\n",
      "was rejected with the deepest abhorrence; and the pope asserted, most\n",
      "probably with truth, that a linen which had been sanctified in the\n",
      "neighborhood of his body, or the filings of his chain, which it was\n",
      "sometimes easy and sometimes impossible to obtain, possessed an equal\n",

      "first and greatest of the name of Gregory. His grandfather Felix had\n",
      "himself been pope, and as the bishops were already bound by the laws of\n",
      "celibacy, his consecration must have been preceded by the death of his\n",

      "of the senate, and the most pious of the church of Rome; his female\n",
      "relations were numbered among the saints and virgins; and his own\n",
      "figure, with those of his father and mother, were represented near three\n",
      "hundred years in a family portrait, which he offered to the monastery of\n",
      "St. Andrew. The design and coloring of this picture afford an honorable\n",
      "testimony that the art of painting was cultivated by the Italians of the\n",
      "sixth century; but the most abject ideas must be entertained of their\n",
      "taste and learning, since the epistles of Gregory, his sermons, and his\n",
      "dialogues, are the work of a man who was second in erudition to none of\n",
      "his contemporaries: his birth and abilities had raised him to the office\n",
      "of prÊfect of the city, and he enjoyed the merit of renouncing the pomps\n",
      "and vanities of this world. His ample patrimony was dedicated to the\n",
      "foundation of seven monasteries, one in Rome, and six in Sicily; and\n",
      "it was the wish of Gregory that he might be unknown in this life, and\n",
      "glorious only in the next. Yet his devotion (and it might be sincere)\n",
      "pursued the path which would have been chosen by a crafty and ambitious\n",
      "statesman. The talents of Gregory, and the splendor which accompanied\n",
      "his retreat, rendered him dear and useful to the church; and implicit\n",
      "obedience has always been inculcated as the first duty of a monk. As\n",
      "soon as he had received the character of deacon, Gregory was sent to\n",
      "reside at the Byzantine court, the nuncio or minister of the apostolic\n",
      "see; and he boldly assumed, in the name of St. Peter, a tone of\n",
      "independent dignity, which would have been criminal and dangerous in the\n",
      "most illustrious layman of the empire. He returned to Rome with a just\n",
      "increase of reputation, and, after a short exercise of the monastic\n",
      "virtues, he was dragged from the cloister to the papal throne, by the\n",
      "unanimous voice of the clergy, the senate, and the people. He alone\n",
      "resisted, or seemed to resist, his own elevation; and his humble\n",
      "petition, that Maurice would be pleased to reject the choice of the\n",
      "Romans, could only serve to exalt his character in the eyes of the\n",
      "emperor and the public. When the fatal mandate was proclaimed, Gregory\n",
      "solicited the aid of some friendly merchants to convey him in a basket\n",
      "beyond the gates of Rome, and modestly concealed himself some days among\n",
      "the woods and mountains, till his retreat was discovered, as it is said,\n",
      "by a celestial light.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pontificate of Gregory the _Great_, which lasted thirteen years, six\n",
      "months, and ten days, is one of the most edifying periods of the history\n",
      "of the church. His virtues, and even his faults, a singular mixture\n",
      "of simplicity and cunning, of pride and humility, of sense and\n",
      "superstition, were happily suited to his station and to the temper of\n",
      "the times. In his rival, the patriarch of Constantinople, he condemned\n",
      "the anti-Christian title of universal bishop, which the successor of\n",
      "St. Peter was too haughty to concede, and too feeble to assume; and\n",
      "the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Gregory was confined to the triple\n",
      "character of Bishop of Rome, Primate of Italy, and Apostle of the West.\n",
      "He frequently ascended the pulpit, and kindled, by his rude, though\n",
      "pathetic, eloquence, the congenial passions of his audience: the\n",
      "language of the Jewish prophets was interpreted and applied; and the\n",
      "minds of a people, depressed by their present calamities, were directed\n",
      "to the hopes and fears of the invisible world. His precepts and\n",
      "example defined the model of the Roman liturgy; the distribution of the\n",
      "parishes, the calendar of the festivals, the order of processions, the\n",
      "service of the priests and deacons, the variety and change of sacerdotal\n",
      "garments. Till the last days of his life, he officiated in the canon\n",
      "of the mass, which continued above three hours: the Gregorian chant has\n",
      "preserved the vocal and instrumental music of the theatre, and the rough\n",
      "voices of the Barbarians attempted to imitate the melody of the Roman\n",
      "school. Experience had shown him the efficacy of these solemn and\n",
      "pompous rites, to soothe the distress, to confirm the faith, to mitigate\n",
      "the fierceness, and to dispel the dark enthusiasm of the vulgar, and he\n",
      "readily forgave their tendency to promote the reign of priesthood and\n",
      "superstition. The bishops of Italy and the adjacent islands acknowledged\n",
      "the Roman pontiff as their special metropolitan. Even the existence, the\n",
      "union, or the translation of episcopal seats was decided by his absolute\n",
      "discretion: and his successful inroads into the provinces of Greece,\n",
      "of Spain, and of Gaul, might countenance the more lofty pretensions\n",
      "of succeeding popes. He interposed to prevent the abuses of popular\n",
      "elections; his jealous care maintained the purity of faith and\n",
      "discipline; and the apostolic shepherd assiduously watched over the\n",
      "faith and discipline of the subordinate pastors. Under his reign, the\n",
      "Arians of Italy and Spain were reconciled to the Catholic church, and\n",
      "the conquest of Britain reflects less glory on the name of CÊsar, than\n",
      "on that of Gregory the First. Instead of six legions, forty monks were\n",
      "embarked for that distant island, and the pontiff lamented the austere\n",
      "duties which forbade him to partake the perils of their spiritual\n",
      "warfare. In less than two years, he could announce to the archbishop of\n",
      "Alexandria, that they had baptized the king of Kent with ten thousand\n",
      "of his Anglo-Saxons, and that the Roman missionaries, like those of\n",
      "the primitive church, were armed only with spiritual and supernatural\n",
      "powers. The credulity or the prudence of Gregory was always disposed to\n",
      "confirm the truths of religion by the evidence of ghosts, miracles, and\n",
      "resurrections; and posterity has paid to _his_ memory the same tribute\n",
      "which he freely granted to the virtue of his own or the preceding\n",
      "generation. The celestial honors have been liberally bestowed by the\n",
      "authority of the popes, but Gregory is the last of their own order whom\n",
      "they have presumed to inscribe in the calendar of saints.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their temporal power insensibly arose from the calamities of the times:\n",
      "and the Roman bishops, who have deluged Europe and Asia with blood, were\n",
      "compelled to reign as the ministers of charity and peace. I. The church\n",
      "of Rome, as it has been formerly observed, was endowed with ample\n",
      "possessions in Italy, Sicily, and the more distant provinces; and her\n",
      "agents, who were commonly sub-deacons, had acquired a civil, and even\n",
      "criminal, jurisdiction over their tenants and husbandmen. The successor\n",
      "of St. Peter administered his patrimony with the temper of a vigilant\n",
      "and moderate landlord; and the epistles of Gregory are filled with\n",
      "salutary instructions to abstain from doubtful or vexatious lawsuits;\n",
      "to preserve the integrity of weights and measures; to grant every\n",
      "reasonable delay; and to reduce the capitation of the slaves of\n",
      "the glebe, who purchased the right of marriage by the payment of an\n",
      "arbitrary fine. The rent or the produce of these estates was transported\n",
      "to the mouth of the Tyber, at the risk and expense of the pope: in the\n",
      "use of wealth he acted like a faithful steward of the church and the\n",
      "poor, and liberally applied to their wants the inexhaustible resources\n",
      "of abstinence and order. The voluminous account of his receipts and\n",
      "disbursements was kept above three hundred years in the Lateran, as\n",
      "the model of Christian economy. On the four great festivals, he divided\n",
      "their quarterly allowance to the clergy, to his domestics, to the\n",
      "monasteries, the churches, the places of burial, the almshouses, and\n",
      "the hospitals of Rome, and the rest of the diocese. On the first day of\n",
      "every month, he distributed to the poor, according to the season, their\n",
      "stated portion of corn, wine, cheese, vegetables, oil, fish, fresh\n",
      "provisions, clothes, and money; and his treasurers were continually\n",
      "summoned to satisfy, in his name, the extraordinary demands of indigence\n",
      "and merit. The instant distress of the sick and helpless, of strangers\n",
      "and pilgrims, was relieved by the bounty of each day, and of every hour;\n",
      "nor would the pontiff indulge himself in a frugal repast, till he had\n",
      "sent the dishes from his own table to some objects deserving of his\n",
      "compassion. The misery of the times had reduced the nobles and matrons\n",
      "of Rome to accept, without a blush, the benevolence of the church: three\n",
      "thousand virgins received their food and raiment from the hand of their\n",
      "benefactor; and many bishops of Italy escaped from the Barbarians to the\n",
      "hospitable threshold of the Vatican. Gregory might justly be styled\n",
      "the Father of his Country; and such was the extreme sensibility of his\n",
      "conscience, that, for the death of a beggar who had perished in the\n",
      "streets, he interdicted himself during several days from the exercise\n",
      "of sacerdotal functions. II. The misfortunes of Rome involved the\n",
      "apostolical pastor in the business of peace and war; and it might be\n",
      "doubtful to himself, whether piety or ambition prompted him to supply\n",
      "the place of his absent sovereign. Gregory awakened the emperor from\n",
      "a long slumber; exposed the guilt or incapacity of the exarch and his\n",
      "inferior ministers; complained that the veterans were withdrawn from\n",
      "Rome for the defence of Spoleto; encouraged the Italians to guard their\n",
      "cities and altars; and condescended, in the crisis of danger, to name\n",
      "the tribunes, and to direct the operations, of the provincial troops.\n",
      "But the martial spirit of the pope was checked by the scruples of\n",
      "humanity and religion: the imposition of tribute, though it was employed\n",
      "in the Italian war, he freely condemned as odious and oppressive; whilst\n",
      "he protected, against the Imperial edicts, the pious cowardice of the\n",
      "soldiers who deserted a military for a monastic life If we may credit\n",
      "his own declarations, it would have been easy for Gregory to exterminate\n",
      "the Lombards by their domestic factions, without leaving a king, a duke,\n",
      "or a count, to save that unfortunate nation from the vengeance of their\n",
      "foes As a Christian bishop, he preferred the salutary offices of peace;\n",
      "his mediation appeased the tumult of arms: but he was too conscious of\n",
      "the arts of the Greeks, and the passions of the Lombards, to engage his\n",
      "sacred promise for the observance of the truce. Disappointed in the hope\n",
      "of a general and lasting treaty, he presumed to save his country without\n",
      "the consent of the emperor or the exarch. The sword of the enemy was\n",
      "suspended over Rome; it was averted by the mild eloquence and seasonable\n",
      "gifts of the pontiff, who commanded the respect of heretics and\n",

      "important fortress had been left destitute of troops and magazines, the\n",
      "valor of the inhabitants resisted above five months the archers, the\n",
      "elephants, and the military engines of the Great King. In the mean while\n",
      "his general Adarman advanced from Babylon, traversed the desert, passed\n",
      "the Euphrates, insulted the suburbs of Antioch, reduced to ashes the\n",
      "city of Apamea, and laid the spoils of Syria at the feet of his master,\n",
      "whose perseverance in the midst of winter at length subverted the\n",

      "and the court, produced a salutary effect in the repentance and\n",
      "abdication of the emperor Justin: a new spirit arose in the Byzantine\n",
      "councils; and a truce of three years was obtained by the prudence of\n",
      "Tiberius. That seasonable interval was employed in the preparations\n",
      "of war; and the voice of rumor proclaimed to the world, that from\n",
      "the distant countries of the Alps and the Rhine, from Scythia, MÊsia,\n",
      "Pannonia, Illyricum, and Isauria, the strength of the Imperial cavalry\n",
      "was reÎnforced with one hundred and fifty thousand soldiers. Yet the\n",

      "ambassadors of Tiberius, arrogantly commanded them to await his arrival\n",
      "at CÊsarea, the metropolis of the Cappadocian provinces. The two armies\n",

      "who darkened the air with a cloud of arrows, prolonged their line, and\n",
      "extended their wings across the plain; while the Romans, in deep and\n",
      "solid bodies, expected to prevail in closer action, by the weight of\n",
      "their swords and lances. A Scythian chief, who commanded their right\n",
      "wing, suddenly turned the flank of the enemy, attacked their rear-guard\n",
      "in the presence of Chosroes, penetrated to the midst of the camp,\n",
      "pillaged the royal tent, profaned the eternal fire, loaded a train of\n",
      "camels with the spoils of Asia, cut his way through the Persian host,\n",
      "and returned with songs of victory to his friends, who had consumed the\n",
      "day in single combats, or ineffectual skirmishes. The darkness of the\n",
      "night, and the separation of the Romans, afforded the Persian monarch an\n",
      "opportunity of revenge; and one of their camps was swept away by a rapid\n",
      "and impetuous assault. But the review of his loss, and the consciousness\n",
      "of his danger, determined Chosroes to a speedy retreat: he burnt, in his\n",
      "passage, the vacant town of Melitene; and, without consulting the safety\n",
      "of his troops, boldly swam the Euphrates on the back of an elephant.\n",
      "After this unsuccessful campaign, the want of magazines, and perhaps\n",
      "some inroad of the Turks, obliged him to disband or divide his forces;\n",
      "the Romans were left masters of the field, and their general Justinian,\n",
      "advancing to the relief of the Persarmenian rebels, erected his standard\n",
      "on the banks of the Araxes. The great Pompey had formerly halted within\n",
      "three days' march of the Caspian: that inland sea was explored, for\n",
      "the first time, by a hostile fleet, and seventy thousand captives were\n",
      "transplanted from Hyrcania to the Isle of Cyprus. On the return of\n",
      "spring, Justinian descended into the fertile plains of Assyria; the\n",
      "flames of war approached the residence of Nushirvan; the indignant\n",
      "monarch sunk into the grave; and his last edict restrained his\n",
      "successors from exposing their person in battle against the Romans.\n",
      "Yet the memory of this transient affront was lost in the glories of a\n",
      "long reign; and his formidable enemies, after indulging their dream of\n",
      "conquest, again solicited a short respite from the calamities of war.\n",
      "\n",
      "The throne of Chosroes Nushirvan was filled by Hormouz, or Hormisdas,\n",
      "the eldest or the most favored of his sons. With the kingdoms of Persia\n",
      "and India, he inherited the reputation and example of his father, the\n",
      "service, in every rank, of his wise and valiant officers, and a general\n",
      "system of administration, harmonized by time and political wisdom to\n",
      "promote the happiness of the prince and people. But the royal youth\n",
      "enjoyed a still more valuable blessing, the friendship of a sage who had\n",
      "presided over his education, and who always preferred the honor to the\n",
      "interest of his pupil, his interest to his inclination. In a dispute\n",
      "with the Greek and Indian philosophers, Buzurg had once maintained, that\n",
      "the most grievous misfortune of life is old age without the remembrance\n",
      "of virtue; and our candor will presume that the same principle compelled\n",
      "him, during three years, to direct the councils of the Persian empire.\n",
      "His zeal was rewarded by the gratitude and docility of Hormouz, who\n",
      "acknowledged himself more indebted to his preceptor than to his parent:\n",
      "but when age and labor had impaired the strength, and perhaps the\n",
      "faculties, of this prudent counsellor, he retired from court, and\n",
      "abandoned the youthful monarch to his own passions and those of his\n",
      "favorites. By the fatal vicissitude of human affairs, the same scenes\n",
      "were renewed at Ctesiphon, which had been exhibited at Rome after the\n",
      "death of Marcus Antoninus. The ministers of flattery and corruption, who\n",
      "had been banished by his father, were recalled and cherished by the son;\n",
      "the disgrace and exile of the friends of Nushirvan established their\n",
      "tyranny; and virtue was driven by degrees from the mind of Hormouz, from\n",
      "his palace, and from the government of the state. The faithful agents,\n",
      "the eyes and ears of the king, informed him of the progress of disorder,\n",
      "that the provincial governors flew to their prey with the fierceness of\n",
      "lions and eagles, and that their rapine and injustice would teach the\n",
      "most loyal of his subjects to abhor the name and authority of their\n",
      "sovereign. The sincerity of this advice was punished with death; the\n",
      "murmurs of the cities were despised, their tumults were quelled by\n",
      "military execution: the intermediate powers between the throne and the\n",
      "people were abolished; and the childish vanity of Hormouz, who affected\n",
      "the daily use of the tiara, was fond of declaring, that he alone would\n",
      "be the judge as well as the master of his kingdom. In every word, and in\n",
      "every action, the son of Nushirvan degenerated from the virtues of his\n",
      "father. His avarice defrauded the troops; his jealous caprice degraded\n",
      "the satraps; the palace, the tribunals, the waters of the Tigris, were\n",
      "stained with the blood of the innocent, and the tyrant exulted in the\n",
      "sufferings and execution of thirteen thousand victims. As the excuse of\n",
      "his cruelty, he sometimes condescended to observe, that the fears of\n",
      "the Persians would be productive of hatred, and that their hatred must\n",
      "terminate in rebellion but he forgot that his own guilt and folly had\n",
      "inspired the sentiments which he deplored, and prepared the event which\n",
      "he so justly apprehended. Exasperated by long and hopeless oppression,\n",

      "the Romans, in slow sieges and frequent inroads, afflicted the frontiers\n",

      "of Christ, whose mild aspect should never have been displayed in the\n",

      "invaded by the great khan, who passed the Oxus at the head of three\n",

      "ungrateful slave; the proud and ambiguous reproach of despotism, since\n",
      "he was truly descended from the ancient princes of Rei, one of the seven\n",
      "families whose splendid, as well as substantial, prerogatives exalted\n",
      "them above the heads of the Persian nobility. At the siege of Dara, the\n",
      "valor of Bahram was signalized under the eyes of Nushirvan, and both the\n",
      "father and son successively promoted him to the command of armies, the\n",
      "government of Media, and the superintendence of the palace. The popular\n",
      "prediction which marked him as the deliverer of Persia, might be\n",
      "inspired by his past victories and extraordinary figure: the epithet\n",

      "while Hormouz disguised his terror by the name of suspicion, and his\n",
      "servants concealed their disloyalty under the mask of fear, Bahram alone\n",
      "displayed his undaunted courage and apparent fidelity: and as soon as\n",
      "he found that no more than twelve thousand soldiers would follow him\n",
      "against the enemy; he prudently declared, that to this fatal number\n",
      "Heaven had reserved the honors of the triumph. The steep and narrow\n",
      "descent of the Pule Rudbar, or Hyrcanian rock, is the only pass through\n",
      "which an army can penetrate into the territory of Rei and the plains\n",
      "of Media. From the commanding heights, a band of resolute men might\n",
      "overwhelm with stones and darts the myriads of the Turkish host: their\n",
      "emperor and his son were transpierced with arrows; and the fugitives\n",
      "were left, without counsel or provisions, to the revenge of an injured\n",
      "people. The patriotism of the Persian general was stimulated by his\n",
      "affection for the city of his forefathers: in the hour of victory, every\n",
      "peasant became a soldier, and every soldier a hero; and their ardor was\n",
      "kindled by the gorgeous spectacle of beds, and thrones, and tables of\n",
      "massy gold, the spoils of Asia, and the luxury of the hostile camp. A\n",
      "prince of a less malignant temper could not easily have forgiven\n",
      "his benefactor; and the secret hatred of Hormouz was envenomed by a\n",
      "malicious report, that Bahram had privately retained the most precious\n",
      "fruits of his Turkish victory. But the approach of a Roman army on\n",
      "the side of the Araxes compelled the implacable tyrant to smile and to\n",
      "applaud; and the toils of Bahram were rewarded with the permission of\n",
      "encountering a new enemy, by their skill and discipline more formidable\n",
      "than a Scythian multitude. Elated by his recent success, he despatched\n",
      "a herald with a bold defiance to the camp of the Romans, requesting them\n",
      "to fix a day of battle, and to choose whether they would pass the river\n",
      "themselves, or allow a free passage to the arms of the great king. The\n",
      "lieutenant of the emperor Maurice preferred the safer alternative; and\n",
      "this local circumstance, which would have enhanced the victory of\n",
      "the Persians, rendered their defeat more bloody and their escape more\n",
      "difficult. But the loss of his subjects, and the danger of his kingdom,\n",
      "were overbalanced in the mind of Hormouz by the disgrace of his personal\n",
      "enemy; and no sooner had Bahram collected and reviewed his forces, than\n",
      "he received from a royal messenger the insulting gift of a distaff, a\n",
      "spinning-wheel, and a complete suit of female apparel. Obedient to the\n",
      "will of his sovereign he showed himself to the soldiers in this unworthy\n",
      "disguise they resented his ignominy and their own; a shout of rebellion\n",
      "ran through the ranks; and the general accepted their oath of fidelity\n",
      "and vows of revenge. A second messenger, who had been commanded to bring\n",
      "the rebel in chains, was trampled under the feet of an elephant, and\n",
      "manifestos were diligently circulated, exhorting the Persians to assert\n",
      "their freedom against an odious and contemptible tyrant. The defection\n",
      "was rapid and universal; his loyal slaves were sacrificed to the public\n",
      "fury; the troops deserted to the standard of Bahram; and the provinces\n",
      "again saluted the deliverer of his country.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the passes were faithfully guarded, Hormouz could only compute the\n",
      "number of his enemies by the testimony of a guilty conscience, and the\n",
      "daily defection of those who, in the hour of his distress, avenged their\n",
      "wrongs, or forgot their obligations. He proudly displayed the ensigns of\n",
      "royalty; but the city and palace of Modain had already escaped from\n",
      "the hand of the tyrant. Among the victims of his cruelty, Bindoes, a\n",
      "Sassanian prince, had been cast into a dungeon; his fetters were broken\n",
      "by the zeal and courage of a brother; and he stood before the king at\n",
      "the head of those trusty guards, who had been chosen as the ministers\n",
      "of his confinement, and perhaps of his death. Alarmed by the hasty\n",
      "intrusion and bold reproaches of the captive, Hormouz looked round,\n",
      "but in vain, for advice or assistance; discovered that his strength\n",
      "consisted in the obedience of others; and patiently yielded to the\n",
      "single arm of Bindoes, who dragged him from the throne to the same\n",
      "dungeon in which he himself had been so lately confined. At the first\n",
      "tumult, Chosroes, the eldest of the sons of Hormouz, escaped from the\n",
      "city; he was persuaded to return by the pressing and friendly invitation\n",
      "of Bindoes, who promised to seat him on his father's throne, and who\n",
      "expected to reign under the name of an inexperienced youth. In the just\n",
      "assurance, that his accomplices could neither forgive nor hope to be\n",
      "forgiven, and that every Persian might be trusted as the judge and enemy\n",
      "of the tyrant, he instituted a public trial without a precedent and\n",
      "without a copy in the annals of the East. The son of Nushirvan, who had\n",
      "requested to plead in his own defence, was introduced as a criminal into\n",
      "the full assembly of the nobles and satraps. He was heard with decent\n",
      "attention as long as he expatiated on the advantages of order and\n",
      "obedience, the danger of innovation, and the inevitable discord of those\n",
      "who had encouraged each other to trample on their lawful and hereditary\n",
      "sovereign. By a pathetic appeal to their humanity, he extorted that pity\n",
      "which is seldom refused to the fallen fortunes of a king; and while they\n",
      "beheld the abject posture and squalid appearance of the prisoner,\n",
      "his tears, his chains, and the marks of ignominious stripes, it was\n",
      "impossible to forget how recently they had adored the divine splendor of\n",
      "his diadem and purple. But an angry murmur arose in the assembly as soon\n",
      "as he presumed to vindicate his conduct, and to applaud the victories\n",
      "of his reign. He defined the duties of a king, and the Persian nobles\n",
      "listened with a smile of contempt; they were fired with indignation\n",
      "when he dared to vilify the character of Chosroes; and by the indiscreet\n",
      "offer of resigning the sceptre to the second of his sons, he subscribed\n",
      "his own condemnation, and sacrificed the life of his own innocent\n",
      "favorite. The mangled bodies of the boy and his mother were exposed to\n",
      "the people; the eyes of Hormouz were pierced with a hot needle; and the\n",
      "punishment of the father was succeeded by the coronation of his eldest\n",
      "son. Chosroes had ascended the throne without guilt, and his piety\n",
      "strove to alleviate the misery of the abdicated monarch; from the\n",
      "dungeon he removed Hormouz to an apartment of the palace, supplied with\n",
      "liberality the consolations of sensual enjoyment, and patiently endured\n",
      "the furious sallies of his resentment and despair. He might despise the\n",
      "resentment of a blind and unpopular tyrant, but the tiara was trembling\n",
      "on his head, till he could subvert the power, or acquire the friendship,\n",
      "of the great Bahram, who sternly denied the justice of a revolution, in\n",
      "which himself and his soldiers, the true representatives of Persia, had\n",
      "never been consulted. The offer of a general amnesty, and of the second\n",
      "rank in his kingdom, was answered by an epistle from Bahram, friend of\n",
      "the gods, conqueror of men, and enemy of tyrants, the satrap of satraps,\n",
      "general of the Persian armies, and a prince adorned with the title of\n",
      "eleven virtues. He commands Chosroes, the son of Hormouz, to shun the\n",
      "example and fate of his father, to confine the traitors who had been\n",
      "released from their chains, to deposit in some holy place the diadem\n",
      "which he had usurped, and to accept from his gracious benefactor the\n",
      "pardon of his faults and the government of a province. The rebel might\n",
      "not be proud, and the king most assuredly was not humble; but the one\n",
      "was conscious of his strength, the other was sensible of his weakness;\n",
      "and even the modest language of his reply still left room for treaty and\n",
      "reconciliation. Chosroes led into the field the slaves of the palace and\n",
      "the populace of the capital: they beheld with terror the banners of a\n",
      "veteran army; they were encompassed and surprised by the evolutions\n",
      "of the general; and the satraps who had deposed Hormouz, received the\n",
      "punishment of their revolt, or expiated their first treason by a second\n",
      "and more criminal act of disloyalty. The life and liberty of Chosroes\n",
      "were saved, but he was reduced to the necessity of imploring aid or\n",
      "refuge in some foreign land; and the implacable Bindoes, anxious to\n",
      "secure an unquestionable title, hastily returned to the palace, and\n",
      "ended, with a bowstring, the wretched existence of the son of Nushirvan.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Chosroes despatched the preparations of his retreat, he\n",
      "deliberated with his remaining friends, whether he should lurk in the\n",
      "valleys of Mount Caucasus, or fly to the tents of the Turks, or solicit\n",
      "the protection of the emperor. The long emulation of the successors\n",
      "of Artaxerxes and Constantine increased his reluctance to appear as a\n",
      "suppliant in a rival court; but he weighed the forces of the Romans,\n",
      "and prudently considered that the neighborhood of Syria would render his\n",
      "escape more easy and their succors more effectual. Attended only by his\n",
      "concubines, and a troop of thirty guards, he secretly departed from the\n",
      "capital, followed the banks of the Euphrates, traversed the desert,\n",
      "and halted at the distance of ten miles from Circesium. About the third\n",
      "watch of the night, the Roman prÊfect was informed of his approach, and\n",
      "he introduced the royal stranger to the fortress at the dawn of day.\n",
      "From thence the king of Persia was conducted to the more honorable\n",
      "residence of Hierapolis; and Maurice dissembled his pride, and displayed\n",
      "his benevolence, at the reception of the letters and ambassadors of\n",
      "the grandson of Nushirvan. They humbly represented the vicissitudes of\n",
      "fortune and the common interest of princes, exaggerated the ingratitude\n",
      "of Bahram, the agent of the evil principle, and urged, with specious\n",
      "argument, that it was for the advantage of the Romans themselves to\n",
      "support the two monarchies which balance the world, the two great\n",
      "luminaries by whose salutary influence it is vivified and adorned. The\n",
      "anxiety of Chosroes was soon relieved by the assurance, that the emperor\n",
      "had espoused the cause of justice and royalty; but Maurice prudently\n",
      "declined the expense and delay of his useless visit to Constantinople.\n",
      "In the name of his generous benefactor, a rich diadem was presented\n",
      "to the fugitive prince, with an inestimable gift of jewels and gold; a\n",
      "powerful army was assembled on the frontiers of Syria and Armenia, under\n",
      "the command of the valiant and faithful Narses, and this general, of\n",
      "his own nation, and his own choice, was directed to pass the Tigris, and\n",
      "never to sheathe his sword till he had restored Chosroes to the throne\n",
      "of his ancestors. The enterprise, however splendid, was less arduous\n",
      "than it might appear. Persia had already repented of her fatal rashness,\n",
      "which betrayed the heir of the house of Sassan to the ambition of a\n",
      "rebellious subject: and the bold refusal of the Magi to consecrate his\n",
      "usurpation, compelled Bahram to assume the sceptre, regardless of the\n",
      "laws and prejudices of the nation. The palace was soon distracted with\n",
      "conspiracy, the city with tumult, the provinces with insurrection; and\n",
      "the cruel execution of the guilty and the suspected served to irritate\n",
      "rather than subdue the public discontent. No sooner did the grandson of\n",
      "Nushirvan display his own and the Roman banners beyond the Tigris, than\n",
      "he was joined, each day, by the increasing multitudes of the nobility\n",
      "and people; and as he advanced, he received from every side the grateful\n",
      "offerings of the keys of his cities and the heads of his enemies. As\n",
      "soon as Modain was freed from the presence of the usurper, the loyal\n",
      "inhabitants obeyed the first summons of Mebodes at the head of only two\n",
      "thousand horse, and Chosroes accepted the sacred and precious ornaments\n",
      "of the palace as the pledge of their truth and the presage of his\n",
      "approaching success. After the junction of the Imperial troops, which\n",
      "Bahram vainly struggled to prevent, the contest was decided by two\n",
      "battles on the banks of the Zab, and the confines of Media. The Romans,\n",
      "with the faithful subjects of Persia, amounted to sixty thousand, while\n",
      "the whole force of the usurper did not exceed forty thousand men: the\n",
      "two generals signalized their valor and ability; but the victory was\n",
      "finally determined by the prevalence of numbers and discipline. With the\n",
      "remnant of a broken army, Bahram fled towards the eastern provinces of\n",
      "the Oxus: the enmity of Persia reconciled him to the Turks; but his days\n",
      "were shortened by poison, perhaps the most incurable of poisons; the\n",
      "stings of remorse and despair, and the bitter remembrance of lost glory.\n",
      "Yet the modern Persians still commemorate the exploits of Bahram; and\n",
      "some excellent laws have prolonged the duration of his troubled and\n",
      "transitory reign.\n",
      "\n",
      "The restoration of Chosroes was celebrated with feasts and executions;\n",
      "and the music of the royal banquet was often disturbed by the groans\n",
      "of dying or mutilated criminals. A general pardon might have diffused\n",
      "comfort and tranquillity through a country which had been shaken by\n",
      "the late revolutions; yet, before the sanguinary temper of Chosroes is\n",
      "blamed, we should learn whether the Persians had not been accustomed\n",
      "either to dread the rigor, or to despise the weakness, of their\n",
      "sovereign. The revolt of Bahram, and the conspiracy of the satraps, were\n",
      "impartially punished by the revenge or justice of the conqueror; the\n",
      "merits of Bindoes himself could not purify his hand from the guilt\n",
      "of royal blood: and the son of Hormouz was desirous to assert his own\n",
      "innocence, and to vindicate the sanctity of kings. During the vigor of\n",
      "the Roman power, several princes were seated on the throne of Persia by\n",
      "the arms and the authority of the first CÊsars. But their new subjects\n",
      "were soon disgusted with the vices or virtues which they had imbibed in\n",
      "a foreign land; the instability of their dominion gave birth to a vulgar\n",
      "observation, that the choice of Rome was solicited and rejected with\n",
      "equal ardor by the capricious levity of Oriental slaves. But the glory\n",
      "of Maurice was conspicuous in the long and fortunate reign of his _son_\n",
      "and his ally. A band of a thousand Romans, who continued to guard the\n",
      "person of Chosroes, proclaimed his confidence in the fidelity of the\n",
      "strangers; his growing strength enabled him to dismiss this unpopular\n",
      "aid, but he steadily professed the same gratitude and reverence to his\n",
      "adopted father; and till the death of Maurice, the peace and alliance of\n",
      "the two empires were faithfully maintained. Yet the mercenary friendship\n",
      "of the Roman prince had been purchased with costly and important gifts;\n",
      "the strong cities of Martyropolis and Dara were restored, and the\n",
      "Persarmenians became the willing subjects of an empire, whose eastern\n",
      "limit was extended, beyond the example of former times, as far as the\n",
      "banks of the Araxes, and the neighborhood of the Caspian. A pious hope\n",
      "was indulged, that the church as well as the state might triumph in\n",
      "this revolution: but if Chosroes had sincerely listened to the Christian\n",
      "bishops, the impression was erased by the zeal and eloquence of the\n",
      "Magi: if he was armed with philosophic indifference, he accommodated his\n",
      "belief, or rather his professions, to the various circumstances of an\n",
      "exile and a sovereign. The imaginary conversion of the king of Persia\n",
      "was reduced to a local and superstitious veneration for Sergius, one\n",
      "of the saints of Antioch, who heard his prayers and appeared to him in\n",
      "dreams; he enriched the shrine with offerings of gold and silver, and\n",
      "ascribed to this invisible patron the success of his arms, and the\n",
      "pregnancy of Sira, a devout Christian and the best beloved of his wives.\n",
      "The beauty of Sira, or Schirin, her wit, her musical talents, are still\n",
      "famous in the history, or rather in the romances, of the East: her own\n",
      "name is expressive, in the Persian tongue, of sweetness and grace; and\n",
      "the epithet of _Parviz_ alludes to the charms of her royal lover. Yet\n",
      "Sira never shared the passions which she inspired, and the bliss of\n",
      "Chosroes was tortured by a jealous doubt, that while he possessed her\n",

      "While the majesty of the Roman name was revived in the East, the\n",
      "prospect of Europe is less pleasing and less glorious. By the departure\n",
      "of the Lombards, and the ruin of the GepidÊ, the balance of power was\n",
      "destroyed on the Danube; and the Avars spread their permanent dominion\n",
      "from the foot of the Alps to the sea-coast of the Euxine. The reign of\n",
      "Baian is the brightest Êra of their monarchy; their chagan, who occupied\n",
      "the rustic palace of Attila, appears to have imitated his character\n",
      "and policy; but as the same scenes were repeated in a smaller circle, a\n",
      "minute representation of the copy would be devoid of the greatness and\n",
      "novelty of the original. The pride of the second Justin, of Tiberius,\n",
      "and Maurice, was humbled by a proud Barbarian, more prompt to inflict,\n",
      "than exposed to suffer, the injuries of war; and as often as Asia was\n",
      "threatened by the Persian arms, Europe was oppressed by the dangerous\n",
      "inroads, or costly friendship, of the Avars. When the Roman envoys\n",
      "approached the presence of the chagan, they were commanded to wait at\n",
      "the door of his tent, till, at the end perhaps of ten or twelve days,\n",
      "he condescended to admit them. If the substance or the style of their\n",
      "message was offensive to his ear, he insulted, with real or affected\n",
      "fury, their own dignity, and that of their prince; their baggage was\n",
      "plundered, and their lives were only saved by the promise of a richer\n",
      "present and a more respectful address. But _his_ sacred ambassadors\n",
      "enjoyed and abused an unbounded license in the midst of Constantinople:\n",
      "they urged, with importunate clamors, the increase of tribute, or the\n",
      "restitution of captives and deserters: and the majesty of the empire\n",
      "was almost equally degraded by a base compliance, or by the false and\n",
      "fearful excuses with which they eluded such insolent demands. The\n",
      "chagan had never seen an elephant; and his curiosity was excited by the\n",
      "strange, and perhaps fabulous, portrait of that wonderful animal. At\n",
      "his command, one of the largest elephants of the Imperial stables was\n",
      "equipped with stately caparisons, and conducted by a numerous train to\n",
      "the royal village in the plains of Hungary. He surveyed the enormous\n",
      "beast with surprise, with disgust, and possibly with terror; and smiled\n",
      "at the vain industry of the Romans, who, in search of such useless\n",
      "rarities, could explore the limits of the land and sea. He wished, at\n",
      "the expense of the emperor, to repose in a golden bed. The wealth of\n",
      "Constantinople, and the skilful diligence of her artists, were instantly\n",
      "devoted to the gratification of his caprice; but when the work was\n",
      "finished, he rejected with scorn a present so unworthy the majesty of a\n",
      "great king. These were the casual sallies of his pride; but the avarice\n",
      "of the chagan was a more steady and tractable passion: a rich and\n",
      "regular supply of silk apparel, furniture, and plate, introduced the\n",
      "rudiments of art and luxury among the tents of the Scythians; their\n",
      "appetite was stimulated by the pepper and cinnamon of India; the annual\n",
      "subsidy or tribute was raised from fourscore to one hundred and twenty\n",
      "thousand pieces of gold; and after each hostile interruption, the\n",
      "payment of the arrears, with exorbitant interest, was always made the\n",
      "first condition of the new treaty. In the language of a Barbarian,\n",
      "without guile, the prince of the Avars affected to complain of the\n",
      "insincerity of the Greeks; yet he was not inferior to the most civilized\n",
      "nations in the refinement of dissimulation and perfidy. As the successor\n",
      "of the Lombards, the chagan asserted his claim to the important city of\n",
      "Sirmium, the ancient bulwark of the Illyrian provinces. The plains of\n",
      "the Lower Hungary were covered with the Avar horse and a fleet of large\n",

      "the empire. He swore by his sword, the symbol of the god of war, that he\n",
      "did not, as the enemy of Rome, construct a bridge upon the Save. \"If\n",
      "I violate my oath,\" pursued the intrepid Baian, \"may I myself, and the\n",
      "last of my nation, perish by the sword! May the heavens, and fire, the\n",
      "deity of the heavens, fall upon our heads! May the forests and mountains\n",
      "bury us in their ruins! and the Save returning, against the laws of\n",
      "nature, to his source, overwhelm us in his angry waters!\" After this\n",
      "barbarous imprecation, he calmly inquired, what oath was most sacred\n",
      "and venerable among the Christians, what guilt or perjury it was most\n",
      "dangerous to incur. The bishop of Singidunum presented the gospel, which\n",
      "the chagan received with devout reverence. \"I swear,\" said he, \"by the\n",
      "God who has spoken in this holy book, that I have neither falsehood\n",
      "on my tongue, nor treachery in my heart.\" As soon as he rose from his\n",
      "knees, he accelerated the labor of the bridge, and despatched an envoy\n",
      "to proclaim what he no longer wished to conceal. \"Inform the emperor,\"\n",
      "said the perfidious Baian, \"that Sirmium is invested on every side.\n",
      "Advise his prudence to withdraw the citizens and their effects, and to\n",
      "resign a city which it is now impossible to relieve or defend.\" Without\n",
      "the hope of relief, the defence of Sirmium was prolonged above three\n",
      "years: the walls were still untouched; but famine was enclosed within\n",
      "the walls, till a merciful capitulation allowed the escape of the naked\n",
      "and hungry inhabitants. Singidunum, at the distance of fifty miles,\n",
      "experienced a more cruel fate: the buildings were razed, and the\n",
      "vanquished people was condemned to servitude and exile. Yet the ruins of\n",
      "Sirmium are no longer visible; the advantageous situation of Singidunum\n",
      "soon attracted a new colony of Sclavonians, and the conflux of the Save\n",
      "and Danube is still guarded by the fortifications of Belgrade, or the\n",
      "_White City_, so often and so obstinately disputed by the Christian and\n",
      "Turkish arms. From Belgrade to the walls of Constantinople a line may be\n",
      "measured of six hundred miles: that line was marked with flames and with\n",
      "blood; the horses of the Avars were alternately bathed in the Euxine and\n",
      "the Adriatic; and the Roman pontiff, alarmed by the approach of a more\n",
      "savage enemy, was reduced to cherish the Lombards, as the protectors\n",
      "of Italy. The despair of a captive, whom his country refused to ransom,\n",
      "disclosed to the Avars the invention and practice of military engines.\n",
      "But in the first attempts they were rudely framed, and awkwardly\n",
      "managed; and the resistance of Diocletianopolis and BerÊa, of\n",
      "Philippopolis and Adrianople, soon exhausted the skill and patience of\n",
      "the besiegers. The warfare of Baian was that of a Tartar; yet his mind\n",
      "was susceptible of a humane and generous sentiment: he spared Anchialus,\n",
      "whose salutary waters had restored the health of the best beloved of his\n",
      "wives; and the Romans confessed, that their starving army was fed and\n",
      "dismissed by the liberality of a foe. His empire extended over Hungary,\n",
      "Poland, and Prussia, from the mouth of the Danube to that of the Oder;\n",
      "and his new subjects were divided and transplanted by the jealous policy\n",
      "of the conqueror. The eastern regions of Germany, which had been\n",
      "left vacant by the emigration of the Vandals, were replenished with\n",
      "Sclavonian colonists; the same tribes are discovered in the neighborhood\n",
      "of the Adriatic and of the Baltic, and with the name of Baian himself,\n",
      "the Illyrian cities of Neyss and Lissa are again found in the heart of\n",
      "Silesia. In the disposition both of his troops and provinces the chagan\n",
      "exposed the vassals, whose lives he disregarded, to the first assault;\n",
      "and the swords of the enemy were blunted before they encountered the\n",
      "native valor of the Avars.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Persian alliance restored the troops of the East to the defence of\n",
      "Europe: and Maurice, who had supported ten years the insolence of\n",
      "the chagan, declared his resolution to march in person against the\n",
      "Barbarians. In the space of two centuries, none of the successors of\n",
      "Theodosius had appeared in the field: their lives were supinely spent in\n",
      "the palace of Constantinople; and the Greeks could no longer understand,\n",
      "that the name of _emperor_, in its primitive sense, denoted the chief of\n",
      "the armies of the republic. The martial ardor of Maurice was opposed\n",
      "by the grave flattery of the senate, the timid superstition of the\n",
      "patriarch, and the tears of the empress Constantina; and they all\n",
      "conjured him to devolve on some meaner general the fatigues and perils\n",
      "of a Scythian campaign. Deaf to their advice and entreaty, the emperor\n",
      "boldly advanced seven miles from the capital; the sacred ensign of the\n",
      "cross was displayed in the front; and Maurice reviewed, with conscious\n",
      "pride, the arms and numbers of the veterans who had fought and conquered\n",
      "beyond the Tigris. Anchialus was the last term of his progress by sea\n",
      "and land; he solicited, without success, a miraculous answer to his\n",
      "nocturnal prayers; his mind was confounded by the death of a favorite\n",
      "horse, the encounter of a wild boar, a storm of wind and rain, and the\n",
      "birth of a monstrous child; and he forgot that the best of omens is to\n",
      "unsheathe our sword in the defence of our country. Under the pretence\n",
      "of receiving the ambassadors of Persia, the emperor returned to\n",
      "Constantinople, exchanged the thoughts of war for those of devotion,\n",
      "and disappointed the public hope by his absence and the choice of his\n",
      "lieutenants. The blind partiality of fraternal love might excuse the\n",
      "promotion of his brother Peter, who fled with equal disgrace from the\n",
      "Barbarians, from his own soldiers and from the inhabitants of a Roman\n",
      "city. That city, if we may credit the resemblance of name and character,\n",
      "was the famous Azimuntium, which had alone repelled the tempest of\n",
      "Attila. The example of her warlike youth was propagated to succeeding\n",
      "generations; and they obtained, from the first or the second Justin, an\n",
      "honorable privilege, that their valor should be always reserved for the\n",
      "defence of their native country. The brother of Maurice attempted\n",
      "to violate this privilege, and to mingle a patriot band with the\n",
      "mercenaries of his camp; they retired to the church, he was not awed\n",
      "by the sanctity of the place; the people rose in their cause, the gates\n",
      "were shut, the ramparts were manned; and the cowardice of Peter was\n",
      "found equal to his arrogance and injustice. The military fame of\n",
      "Commentiolus is the object of satire or comedy rather than of\n",
      "serious history, since he was even deficient in the vile and vulgar\n",
      "qualification of personal courage. His solemn councils, strange\n",
      "evolutions, and secret orders, always supplied an apology for flight or\n",
      "delay. If he marched against the enemy, the pleasant valleys of Mount\n",
      "HÊmus opposed an insuperable barrier; but in his retreat, he explored,\n",
      "with fearless curiosity, the most difficult and obsolete paths, which\n",
      "had almost escaped the memory of the oldest native. The only blood which\n",
      "he lost was drawn, in a real or affected malady, by the lancet of a\n",
      "surgeon; and his health, which felt with exquisite sensibility the\n",
      "approach of the Barbarians, was uniformly restored by the repose and\n",
      "safety of the winter season. A prince who could promote and support this\n",
      "unworthy favorite must derive no glory from the accidental merit of his\n",
      "colleague Priscus. In five successive battles, which seem to have been\n",
      "conducted with skill and resolution, seventeen thousand two hundred\n",
      "Barbarians were made prisoners: near sixty thousand, with four sons of\n",
      "the chagan, were slain: the Roman general surprised a peaceful district\n",
      "of the GepidÊ, who slept under the protection of the Avars; and his last\n",
      "trophies were erected on the banks of the Danube and the Teyss. Since\n",
      "the death of Trajan the arms of the empire had not penetrated so deeply\n",
      "into the old Dacia: yet the success of Priscus was transient and barren;\n",
      "and he was soon recalled by the apprehension that Baian, with dauntless\n",
      "spirit and recruited forces, was preparing to avenge his defeat under\n",
      "the walls of Constantinople.\n",
      "\n",
      "The theory of war was not more familiar to the camps of CÊsar and\n",
      "Trajan, than to those of Justinian and Maurice. The iron of Tuscany or\n",
      "Pontus still received the keenest temper from the skill of the Byzantine\n",
      "workmen. The magazines were plentifully stored with every species of\n",
      "offensive and defensive arms. In the construction and use of ships,\n",
      "engines, and fortifications, the Barbarians admired the superior\n",
      "ingenuity of a people whom they had so often vanquished in the field.\n",
      "The science of tactics, the order, evolutions, and stratagems of\n",
      "antiquity, was transcribed and studied in the books of the Greeks and\n",
      "Romans. But the solitude or degeneracy of the provinces could no longer\n",
      "supply a race of men to handle those weapons, to guard those walls,\n",
      "to navigate those ships, and to reduce the theory of war into bold and\n",
      "successful practice. The genius of Belisarius and Narses had been formed\n",
      "without a master, and expired without a disciple Neither honor, nor\n",
      "patriotism, nor generous superstition, could animate the lifeless bodies\n",
      "of slaves and strangers, who had succeeded to the honors of the legions:\n",
      "it was in the camp alone that the emperor should have exercised a\n",
      "despotic command; it was only in the camps that his authority was\n",
      "disobeyed and insulted: he appeased and inflamed with gold the\n",
      "licentiousness of the troops; but their vices were inherent, their\n",
      "victories were accidental, and their costly maintenance exhausted the\n",
      "substance of a state which they were unable to defend. After a long and\n",
      "pernicious indulgence, the cure of this inveterate evil was undertaken\n",
      "by Maurice; but the rash attempt, which drew destruction on his own\n",
      "head, tended only to aggravate the disease. A reformer should be exempt\n",
      "from the suspicion of interest, and he must possess the confidence and\n",
      "esteem of those whom he proposes to reclaim. The troops of Maurice\n",
      "might listen to the voice of a victorious leader; they disdained the\n",
      "admonitions of statesmen and sophists; and, when they received an edict\n",
      "which deducted from their pay the price of their arms and clothing, they\n",
      "execrated the avarice of a prince insensible of the dangers and fatigues\n",
      "from which he had escaped. The camps both of Asia and Europe were\n",
      "agitated with frequent and furious seditions; the enraged soldiers\n",
      "of Edessa pursued with reproaches, with threats, with wounds, their\n",
      "trembling generals; they overturned the statues of the emperor, cast\n",
      "stones against the miraculous image of Christ, and either rejected the\n",
      "yoke of all civil and military laws, or instituted a dangerous model of\n",
      "voluntary subordination. The monarch, always distant and often deceived,\n",
      "was incapable of yielding or persisting, according to the exigence of\n",
      "the moment. But the fear of a general revolt induced him too readily to\n",
      "accept any act of valor, or any expression of loyalty, as an atonement\n",
      "for the popular offence; the new reform was abolished as hastily as it\n",
      "had been announced, and the troops, instead of punishment and restraint,\n",
      "were agreeably surprised by a gracious proclamation of immunities and\n",
      "rewards. But the soldiers accepted without gratitude the tardy and\n",
      "reluctant gifts of the emperor: their insolence was elated by the\n",
      "discovery of his weakness and their own strength; and their mutual\n",
      "hatred was inflamed beyond the desire of forgiveness or the hope of\n",
      "reconciliation. The historians of the times adopt the vulgar suspicion,\n",
      "that Maurice conspired to destroy the troops whom he had labored to\n",
      "reform; the misconduct and favor of Commentiolus are imputed to this\n",
      "malevolent design; and every age must condemn the inhumanity of avarice\n",
      "of a prince, who, by the trifling ransom of six thousand pieces of gold,\n",
      "might have prevented the massacre of twelve thousand prisoners in the\n",
      "hands of the chagan. In the just fervor of indignation, an order\n",
      "was signified to the army of the Danube, that they should spare the\n",
      "magazines of the province, and establish their winter quarters in the\n",
      "hostile country of the Avars. The measure of their grievances was full:\n",
      "they pronounced Maurice unworthy to reign, expelled or slaughtered\n",
      "his faithful adherents, and, under the command of Phocas, a\n",
      "simple centurion, returned by hasty marches to the neighborhood of\n",
      "Constantinople. After a long series of legal succession, the military\n",
      "disorders of the third century were again revived; yet such was the\n",
      "novelty of the enterprise, that the insurgents were awed by their\n",
      "own rashness. They hesitated to invest their favorite with the vacant\n",
      "purple; and, while they rejected all treaty with Maurice himself,\n",
      "they held a friendly correspondence with his son Theodosius, and with\n",
      "Germanus, the father-in-law of the royal youth. So obscure had been the\n",
      "former condition of Phocas, that the emperor was ignorant of the\n",
      "name and character of his rival; but as soon as he learned, that the\n",
      "centurion, though bold in sedition, was timid in the face of danger,\n",
      "\"Alas!\" cried the desponding prince, \"if he is a coward, he will surely\n",
      "be a murderer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet if Constantinople had been firm and faithful, the murderer might\n",
      "have spent his fury against the walls; and the rebel army would have\n",
      "been gradually consumed or reconciled by the prudence of the emperor.\n",
      "In the games of the Circus, which he repeated with unusual pomp,\n",
      "Maurice disguised, with smiles of confidence, the anxiety of his heart,\n",
      "condescended to solicit the applause of the _factions_, and flattered\n",
      "their pride by accepting from their respective tribunes a list of nine\n",
      "hundred _blues_ and fifteen hundred _greens_, whom he affected to esteem\n",
      "as the solid pillars of his throne Their treacherous or languid support\n",
      "betrayed his weakness and hastened his fall: the green faction were the\n",
      "secret accomplices of the rebels, and the blues recommended lenity\n",
      "and moderation in a contest with their Roman brethren The rigid and\n",
      "parsimonious virtues of Maurice had long since alienated the hearts of\n",
      "his subjects: as he walked barefoot in a religious procession, he was\n",
      "rudely assaulted with stones, and his guards were compelled to present\n",
      "their iron maces in the defence of his person. A fanatic monk ran\n",
      "through the streets with a drawn sword, denouncing against him the\n",
      "wrath and the sentence of God; and a vile plebeian, who represented\n",
      "his countenance and apparel, was seated on an ass, and pursued by the\n",
      "imprecations of the multitude. The emperor suspected the popularity of\n",
      "Germanus with the soldiers and citizens: he feared, he threatened, but\n",
      "he delayed to strike; the patrician fled to the sanctuary of the church;\n",
      "the people rose in his defence, the walls were deserted by the guards,\n",
      "and the lawless city was abandoned to the flames and rapine of a\n",
      "nocturnal tumult. In a small bark, the unfortunate Maurice, with his\n",
      "wife and nine children, escaped to the Asiatic shore; but the violence\n",
      "of the wind compelled him to land at the church of St. Autonomus, near\n",
      "Chalcedon, from whence he despatched Theodosius, he eldest son, to\n",
      "implore the gratitude and friendship of the Persian monarch. For\n",
      "himself, he refused to fly: his body was tortured with sciatic pains,\n",
      "his mind was enfeebled by superstition; he patiently awaited the event\n",
      "of the revolution, and addressed a fervent and public prayer to the\n",
      "Almighty, that the punishment of his sins might be inflicted in this\n",
      "world rather than in a future life. After the abdication of Maurice, the\n",
      "two factions disputed the choice of an emperor; but the favorite of the\n",
      "blues was rejected by the jealousy of their antagonists, and Germanus\n",
      "himself was hurried along by the crowds who rushed to the palace of\n",
      "Hebdomon, seven miles from the city, to adore the majesty of Phocas the\n",
      "centurion. A modest wish of resigning the purple to the rank and merit\n",
      "of Germanus was opposed by _his_ resolution, more obstinate and equally\n",
      "sincere; the senate and clergy obeyed his summons; and, as soon as\n",
      "the patriarch was assured of his orthodox belief, he consecrated the\n",
      "successful usurper in the church of St. John the Baptist. On the third\n",
      "day, amidst the acclamations of a thoughtless people, Phocas made his\n",
      "public entry in a chariot drawn by four white horses: the revolt of the\n",
      "troops was rewarded by a lavish donative; and the new sovereign, after\n",
      "visiting the palace, beheld from his throne the games of the hippodrome.\n",
      "In a dispute of precedency between the two factions, his partial\n",
      "judgment inclined in favor of the greens. \"Remember that Maurice is\n",
      "still alive,\" resounded from the opposite side; and the indiscreet\n",
      "clamor of the blues admonished and stimulated the cruelty of the tyrant.\n",
      "The ministers of death were despatched to Chalcedon: they dragged\n",
      "the emperor from his sanctuary; and the five sons of Maurice were\n",
      "successively murdered before the eyes of their agonizing parent. At\n",
      "each stroke, which he felt in his heart, he found strength to rehearse\n",
      "a pious ejaculation: \"Thou art just, O Lord! and thy judgments are\n",
      "righteous.\" And such, in the last moments, was his rigid attachment to\n",
      "truth and justice, that he revealed to the soldiers the pious falsehood\n",
      "of a nurse who presented her own child in the place of a royal infant.\n",
      "The tragic scene was finally closed by the execution of the emperor\n",
      "himself, in the twentieth year of his reign, and the sixty-third of his\n",
      "age. The bodies of the father and his five sons were cast into the sea;\n",
      "their heads were exposed at Constantinople to the insults or pity of the\n",
      "multitude; and it was not till some signs of putrefaction had appeared,\n",
      "that Phocas connived at the private burial of these venerable remains.\n",
      "In that grave, the faults and errors of Maurice were kindly interred.\n",
      "His fate alone was remembered; and at the end of twenty years, in the\n",
      "recital of the history of Theophylact, the mournful tale was interrupted\n",
      "by the tears of the audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such tears must have flowed in secret, and such compassion would have\n",
      "been criminal, under the reign of Phocas, who was peaceably acknowledged\n",
      "in the provinces of the East and West. The images of the emperor and his\n",
      "wife Leontia were exposed in the Lateran to the veneration of the\n",
      "clergy and senate of Rome, and afterwards deposited in the palace of the\n",
      "CÊsars, between those of Constantine and Theodosius. As a subject and\n",
      "a Christian, it was the duty of Gregory to acquiesce in the established\n",
      "government; but the joyful applause with which he salutes the fortune of\n",
      "the assassin, has sullied, with indelible disgrace, the character of the\n",
      "saint. The successor of the apostles might have inculcated with decent\n",
      "firmness the guilt of blood, and the necessity of repentance; he is\n",
      "content to celebrate the deliverance of the people and the fall of the\n",
      "oppressor; to rejoice that the piety and benignity of Phocas have been\n",
      "raised by Providence to the Imperial throne; to pray that his hands may\n",
      "be strengthened against all his enemies; and to express a wish,\n",
      "perhaps a prophecy, that, after a long and triumphant reign, he may be\n",
      "transferred from a temporal to an everlasting kingdom. I have already\n",
      "traced the steps of a revolution so pleasing, in Gregory's opinion,\n",
      "both to heaven and earth; and Phocas does not appear less hateful in\n",
      "the exercise than in the acquisition of power The pencil of an impartial\n",
      "historian has delineated the portrait of a monster: his diminutive and\n",
      "deformed person, the closeness of his shaggy eyebrows, his red hair, his\n",
      "beardless chin, and his cheek disfigured and discolored by a formidable\n",
      "scar. Ignorant of letters, of laws, and even of arms, he indulged in\n",
      "the supreme rank a more ample privilege of lust and drunkenness; and his\n",
      "brutal pleasures were either injurious to his subjects or disgraceful\n",
      "to himself. Without assuming the office of a prince, he renounced the\n",
      "profession of a soldier; and the reign of Phocas afflicted Europe with\n",
      "ignominious peace, and Asia with desolating war. His savage temper was\n",
      "inflamed by passion, hardened by fear, and exasperated by resistance\n",
      "of reproach. The flight of Theodosius to the Persian court had been\n",
      "intercepted by a rapid pursuit, or a deceitful message: he was beheaded\n",
      "at Nice, and the last hours of the young prince were soothed by the\n",
      "comforts of religion and the consciousness of innocence. Yet his phantom\n",
      "disturbed the repose of the usurper: a whisper was circulated through\n",
      "the East, that the son of Maurice was still alive: the people expected\n",
      "their avenger, and the widow and daughters of the late emperor would\n",
      "have adopted as their son and brother the vilest of mankind. In the\n",
      "massacre of the Imperial family, the mercy, or rather the discretion, of\n",
      "Phocas had spared these unhappy females, and they were decently confined\n",
      "to a private house. But the spirit of the empress Constantina, still\n",
      "mindful of her father, her husband, and her sons, aspired to freedom\n",
      "and revenge. At the dead of night, she escaped to the sanctuary of St.\n",
      "Sophia; but her tears, and the gold of her associate Germanus, were\n",
      "insufficient to provoke an insurrection. Her life was forfeited to\n",
      "revenge, and even to justice: but the patriarch obtained and pledged an\n",
      "oath for her safety: a monastery was allotted for her prison, and the\n",
      "widow of Maurice accepted and abused the lenity of his assassin.\n",
      "The discovery or the suspicion of a second conspiracy, dissolved the\n",
      "engagements, and rekindled the fury, of Phocas. A matron who commanded\n",
      "the respect and pity of mankind, the daughter, wife, and mother of\n",
      "emperors, was tortured like the vilest malefactor, to force a confession\n",
      "of her designs and associates; and the empress Constantina, with her\n",
      "three innocent daughters, was beheaded at Chalcedon, on the same ground\n",
      "which had been stained with the blood of her husband and five sons.\n",
      "After such an example, it would be superfluous to enumerate the names\n",
      "and sufferings of meaner victims. Their condemnation was seldom preceded\n",
      "by the forms of trial, and their punishment was embittered by the\n",
      "refinements of cruelty: their eyes were pierced, their tongues were torn\n",
      "from the root, the hands and feet were amputated; some expired under the\n",
      "lash, others in the flames; others again were transfixed with arrows;\n",

      "patrician Crispus, and the _royal_ images of the bride and bridegroom\n",
      "were indiscreetly placed in the circus, by the side of the emperor. The\n",
      "father must desire that his posterity should inherit the fruit of his\n",

      "association: the tribunes of the green faction, who accused the\n",
      "officious error of their sculptors, were condemned to instant death:\n",
      "their lives were granted to the prayers of the people; but Crispus might\n",
      "reasonably doubt, whether a jealous usurper could forget and pardon\n",
      "his involuntary competition. The green faction was alienated by the\n",
      "ingratitude of Phocas and the loss of their privileges; every province\n",
      "of the empire was ripe for rebellion; and Heraclius, exarch of Africa,\n",
      "persisted above two years in refusing all tribute and obedience to the\n",
      "centurion who disgraced the throne of Constantinople. By the secret\n",

      "solicited to save and to govern his country; but his ambition was\n",
      "chilled by age, and he resigned the dangerous enterprise to his\n",
      "son Heraclius, and to Nicetas, the son of Gregory, his friend and\n",
      "lieutenant. The powers of Africa were armed by the two adventurous\n",
      "youths; they agreed that the one should navigate the fleet from Carthage\n",
      "to Constantinople, that the other should lead an army through Egypt and\n",
      "Asia, and that the Imperial purple should be the reward of diligence and\n",
      "success. A faint rumor of their undertaking was conveyed to the ears of\n",
      "Phocas, and the wife and mother of the younger Heraclius were secured\n",
      "as the hostages of his faith: but the treacherous heart of Crispus\n",
      "extenuated the distant peril, the means of defence were neglected or\n",
      "delayed, and the tyrant supinely slept till the African navy cast anchor\n",
      "in the Hellespont. Their standard was joined at Abidus by the fugitives\n",
      "and exiles who thirsted for revenge; the ships of Heraclius, whose lofty\n",
      "masts were adorned with the holy symbols of religion, steered their\n",
      "triumphant course through the Propontis; and Phocas beheld from the\n",
      "windows of the palace his approaching and inevitable fate. The green\n",
      "faction was tempted, by gifts and promises, to oppose a feeble and\n",
      "fruitless resistance to the landing of the Africans: but the people, and\n",
      "even the guards, were determined by the well-timed defection of Crispus;\n",

      "vile habit, and loaded with chains, he was transported in a small boat\n",
      "to the Imperial galley of Heraclius, who reproached him with the crimes\n",
      "of his abominable reign. \"Wilt thou govern better?\" were the last words\n",
      "of the despair of Phocas. After suffering each variety of insult and\n",
      "torture, his head was severed from his body, the mangled trunk was cast\n",
      "into the flames, and the same treatment was inflicted on the statues\n",
      "of the vain usurper, and the seditious banner of the green faction. The\n",
      "voice of the clergy, the senate, and the people, invited Heraclius to\n",
      "ascend the throne which he had purified from guilt and ignominy; after\n",
      "some graceful hesitation, he yielded to their entreaties. His coronation\n",
      "was accompanied by that of his wife Eudoxia; and their posterity, till\n",
      "the fourth generation, continued to reign over the empire of the East.\n",
      "The voyage of Heraclius had been easy and prosperous; the tedious march\n",
      "of Nicetas was not accomplished before the decision of the contest:\n",
      "but he submitted without a murmur to the fortune of his friend, and\n",
      "his laudable intentions were rewarded with an equestrian statue, and a\n",
      "daughter of the emperor. It was more difficult to trust the fidelity of\n",
      "Crispus, whose recent services were recompensed by the command of the\n",
      "Cappadocian army. His arrogance soon provoked, and seemed to excuse,\n",
      "the ingratitude of his new sovereign. In the presence of the senate, the\n",
      "son-in-law of Phocas was condemned to embrace the monastic life; and the\n",
      "sentence was justified by the weighty observation of Heraclius, that the\n",
      "man who had betrayed his father could never be faithful to his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even after his death the republic was afflicted by the crimes of Phocas,\n",
      "which armed with a pious cause the most formidable of her enemies.\n",
      "According to the friendly and equal forms of the Byzantine and Persian\n",
      "courts, he announced his exaltation to the throne; and his ambassador\n",
      "Lilius, who had presented him with the heads of Maurice and his sons,\n",
      "was the best qualified to describe the circumstances of the tragic\n",

      "turned with horror from the assassin, imprisoned the pretended envoy,\n",
      "disclaimed the usurper, and declared himself the avenger of his father\n",
      "and benefactor. The sentiments of grief and resentment, which humanity\n",
      "would feel, and honor would dictate, promoted on this occasion the\n",
      "interest of the Persian king; and his interest was powerfully magnified\n",
      "by the national and religious prejudices of the Magi and satraps. In a\n",
      "strain of artful adulation, which assumed the language of freedom, they\n",
      "presumed to censure the excess of his gratitude and friendship for the\n",
      "Greeks; a nation with whom it was dangerous to conclude either peace or\n",
      "alliance; whose superstition was devoid of truth and justice, and who\n",
      "must be incapable of any virtue, since they could perpetrate the most\n",
      "atrocious of crimes, the impious murder of their sovereign. For the\n",
      "crime of an ambitious centurion, the nation which he oppressed was\n",
      "chastised with the calamities of war; and the same calamities, at the\n",
      "end of twenty years, were retaliated and redoubled on the heads of the\n",
      "Persians. The general who had restored Chosroes to the throne still\n",
      "commanded in the East; and the name of Narses was the formidable\n",
      "sound with which the Assyrian mothers were accustomed to terrify their\n",
      "infants. It is not improbable, that a native subject of Persia should\n",
      "encourage his master and his friend to deliver and possess the provinces\n",
      "of Asia. It is still more probable, that Chosroes should animate his\n",
      "troops by the assurance that the sword which they dreaded the most would\n",
      "remain in its scabbard, or be drawn in their favor. The hero could not\n",
      "depend on the faith of a tyrant; and the tyrant was conscious how\n",
      "little he deserved the obedience of a hero. Narses was removed from his\n",
      "military command; he reared an independent standard at Hierapolis, in\n",
      "Syria: he was betrayed by fallacious promises, and burnt alive in the\n",
      "market-place of Constantinople. Deprived of the only chief whom they\n",
      "could fear or esteem, the bands which he had led to victory were twice\n",
      "broken by the cavalry, trampled by the elephants, and pierced by the\n",
      "arrows of the Barbarians; and a great number of the captives were\n",
      "beheaded on the field of battle by the sentence of the victor, who might\n",
      "justly condemn these seditious mercenaries as the authors or accomplices\n",
      "of the death of Maurice. Under the reign of Phocas, the fortifications\n",
      "of Merdin, Dara, Amida, and Edessa, were successively besieged, reduced,\n",
      "and destroyed, by the Persian monarch: he passed the Euphrates, occupied\n",
      "the Syrian cities, Hierapolis, Chalcis, and BerrhÊa or Aleppo, and soon\n",
      "encompassed the walls of Antioch with his irresistible arms. The rapid\n",
      "tide of success discloses the decay of the empire, the incapacity of\n",
      "Phocas, and the disaffection of his subjects; and Chosroes provided\n",
      "a decent apology for their submission or revolt, by an impostor, who\n",
      "attended his camp as the son of Maurice and the lawful heir of the\n",
      "monarchy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first intelligence from the East which Heraclius received, was that\n",
      "of the loss of Antioch; but the aged metropolis, so often overturned\n",
      "by earthquakes, and pillaged by the enemy, could supply but a small\n",
      "and languid stream of treasure and blood. The Persians were equally\n",
      "successful, and more fortunate, in the sack of CÊsarea, the capital of\n",
      "Cappadocia; and as they advanced beyond the ramparts of the frontier,\n",
      "the boundary of ancient war, they found a less obstinate resistance and\n",
      "a more plentiful harvest. The pleasant vale of Damascus has been adorned\n",
      "in every age with a royal city: her obscure felicity has hitherto\n",
      "escaped the historian of the Roman empire: but Chosroes reposed his\n",
      "troops in the paradise of Damascus before he ascended the hills of\n",
      "Libanus, or invaded the cities of the Phnician coast. The conquest of\n",
      "Jerusalem, which had been meditated by Nushirvan, was achieved by the\n",
      "zeal and avarice of his grandson; the ruin of the proudest monument of\n",
      "Christianity was vehemently urged by the intolerant spirit of the Magi;\n",
      "and he could enlist for this holy warfare with an army of six-and-twenty\n",
      "thousand Jews, whose furious bigotry might compensate, in some degree,\n",
      "for the want of valor and discipline. After the reduction of Galilee,\n",
      "and the region beyond the Jordan, whose resistance appears to have\n",
      "delayed the fate of the capital, Jerusalem itself was taken by assault.\n",
      "The sepulchre of Christ, and the stately churches of Helena and\n",
      "Constantine, were consumed, or at least damaged, by the flames; the\n",
      "devout offerings of three hundred years were rifled in one sacrilegious\n",
      "day; the Patriarch Zachariah, and the _true cross_, were transported\n",
      "into Persia; and the massacre of ninety thousand Christians is imputed\n",
      "to the Jews and Arabs, who swelled the disorder of the Persian march.\n",
      "The fugitives of Palestine were entertained at Alexandria by the charity\n",
      "of John the Archbishop, who is distinguished among a crowd of saints\n",
      "by the epithet of _almsgiver_: and the revenues of the church, with a\n",
      "treasure of three hundred thousand pounds, were restored to the true\n",
      "proprietors, the poor of every country and every denomination. But\n",
      "Egypt itself, the only province which had been exempt, since the time\n",
      "of Diocletian, from foreign and domestic war, was again subdued by the\n",
      "successors of Cyrus. Pelusium, the key of that impervious country, was\n",
      "surprised by the cavalry of the Persians: they passed, with impunity,\n",
      "the innumerable channels of the Delta, and explored the long valley\n",
      "of the Nile, from the pyramids of Memphis to the confines of ∆thiopia.\n",
      "Alexandria might have been relieved by a naval force, but the archbishop\n",
      "and the prÊfect embarked for Cyprus; and Chosroes entered the second\n",
      "city of the empire, which still preserved a wealthy remnant of industry\n",
      "and commerce. His western trophy was erected, not on the walls of\n",
      "Carthage, but in the neighborhood of Tripoli; the Greek colonies of\n",
      "Cyrene were finally extirpated; and the conqueror, treading in the\n",
      "footsteps of Alexander, returned in triumph through the sands of the\n",
      "Libyan desert. In the same campaign, another army advanced from the\n",
      "Euphrates to the Thracian Bosphorus; Chalcedon surrendered after a long\n",
      "siege, and a Persian camp was maintained above ten years in the presence\n",
      "of Constantinople. The sea-coast of Pontus, the city of Ancyra, and the\n",
      "Isle of Rhodes, are enumerated among the last conquests of the great\n",
      "king; and if Chosroes had possessed any maritime power, his boundless\n",

      "From the long-disputed banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, the reign of\n",
      "the grandson of Nushirvan was suddenly extended to the Hellespont and\n",
      "the Nile, the ancient limits of the Persian monarchy. But the provinces,\n",
      "which had been fashioned by the habits of six hundred years to the\n",
      "virtues and vices of the Roman government, supported with reluctance\n",
      "the yoke of the Barbarians. The idea of a republic was kept alive by the\n",
      "institutions, or at least by the writings, of the Greeks and Romans, and\n",
      "the subjects of Heraclius had been educated to pronounce the words of\n",
      "liberty and law. But it has always been the pride and policy of Oriental\n",
      "princes to display the titles and attributes of their omnipotence; to\n",
      "upbraid a nation of slaves with their true name and abject condition,\n",
      "and to enforce, by cruel and insolent threats, the rigor of their\n",
      "absolute commands. The Christians of the East were scandalized by the\n",
      "worship of fire, and the impious doctrine of the two principles: the\n",
      "Magi were not less intolerant than the bishops; and the martyrdom of\n",
      "some native Persians, who had deserted the religion of Zoroaster, was\n",
      "conceived to be the prelude of a fierce and general persecution. By the\n",
      "oppressive laws of Justinian, the adversaries of the church were made\n",
      "the enemies of the state; the alliance of the Jews, Nestorians, and\n",
      "Jacobites, had contributed to the success of Chosroes, and his partial\n",
      "favor to the sectaries provoked the hatred and fears of the Catholic\n",
      "clergy. Conscious of their fear and hatred, the Persian conqueror\n",
      "governed his new subjects with an iron sceptre; and, as if he suspected\n",
      "the stability of his dominion, he exhausted their wealth by exorbitant\n",
      "tributes and licentious rapine despoiled or demolished the temples of\n",
      "the East; and transported to his hereditary realms the gold, the silver,\n",
      "the precious marbles, the arts, and the artists of the Asiatic cities.\n",
      "In the obscure picture of the calamities of the empire, it is not easy\n",
      "to discern the figure of Chosroes himself, to separate his actions from\n",
      "those of his lieutenants, or to ascertain his personal merit in the\n",
      "general blaze of glory and magnificence. He enjoyed with ostentation the\n",
      "fruits of victory, and frequently retired from the hardships of war to\n",
      "the luxury of the palace. But in the space of twenty-four years, he was\n",
      "deterred by superstition or resentment from approaching the gates of\n",
      "Ctesiphon: and his favorite residence of Artemita, or Dastagerd,\n",
      "was situate beyond the Tigris, about sixty miles to the north of the\n",
      "capital. The adjacent pastures were covered with flocks and herds: the\n",
      "paradise or park was replenished with pheasants, peacocks, ostriches,\n",
      "roebucks, and wild boars, and the noble game of lions and tigers was\n",
      "sometimes turned loose for the bolder pleasures of the chase. Nine\n",
      "hundred and sixty elephants were maintained for the use or splendor of\n",
      "the great king: his tents and baggage were carried into the field by\n",
      "twelve thousand great camels and eight thousand of a smaller size; and\n",
      "the royal stables were filled with six thousand mules and horses, among\n",
      "whom the names of Shebdiz and Barid are renowned for their speed or\n",
      "beauty. Six thousand guards successively mounted before the palace\n",
      "gate; the service of the interior apartments was performed by twelve\n",
      "thousand slaves, and in the number of three thousand virgins, the\n",
      "fairest of Asia, some happy concubine might console her master for the\n",
      "age or the indifference of Sira. The various treasures of gold, silver,\n",
      "gems, silks, and aromatics, were deposited in a hundred subterraneous\n",
      "vaults and the chamber _Badaverd_ denoted the accidental gift of the\n",
      "winds which had wafted the spoils of Heraclius into one of the Syrian\n",
      "harbors of his rival. The vice of flattery, and perhaps of fiction, is\n",
      "not ashamed to compute the thirty thousand rich hangings that adorned\n",
      "the walls; the forty thousand columns of silver, or more probably of\n",
      "marble, and plated wood, that supported the roof; and the thousand\n",
      "globes of gold suspended in the dome, to imitate the motions of the\n",
      "planets and the constellations of the zodiac. While the Persian monarch\n",
      "contemplated the wonders of his art and power, he received an epistle\n",
      "from an obscure citizen of Mecca, inviting him to acknowledge Mahomet\n",
      "as the apostle of God. He rejected the invitation, and tore the epistle.\n",
      "\"It is thus,\" exclaimed the Arabian prophet, \"that God will tear the\n",
      "kingdom, and reject the supplications of Chosroes.\" Placed on the verge\n",
      "of the two great empires of the East, Mahomet observed with secret\n",
      "joy the progress of their mutual destruction; and in the midst of the\n",
      "Persian triumphs, he ventured to foretell, that before many years should\n",
      "elapse, victory should again return to the banners of the Romans.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time when this prediction is said to have been delivered, no\n",
      "prophecy could be more distant from its accomplishment, since the first\n",
      "twelve years of Heraclius announced the approaching dissolution of the\n",
      "empire. If the motives of Chosroes had been pure and honorable, he\n",
      "must have ended the quarrel with the death of Phocas, and he would have\n",
      "embraced, as his best ally, the fortunate African who had so generously\n",
      "avenged the injuries of his benefactor Maurice. The prosecution of the\n",
      "war revealed the true character of the Barbarian; and the suppliant\n",
      "embassies of Heraclius to beseech his clemency, that he would spare the\n",
      "innocent, accept a tribute, and give peace to the world, were rejected\n",
      "with contemptuous silence or insolent menace. Syria, Egypt, and the\n",
      "provinces of Asia, were subdued by the Persian arms, while Europe, from\n",
      "the confines of Istria to the long wall of Thrace, was oppressed by the\n",
      "Avars, unsatiated with the blood and rapine of the Italian war. They had\n",
      "coolly massacred their male captives in the sacred field of Pannonia;\n",
      "the women and children were reduced to servitude, and the noblest\n",
      "virgins were abandoned to the promiscuous lust of the Barbarians. The\n",
      "amorous matron who opened the gates of Friuli passed a short night in\n",
      "the arms of her royal lover; the next evening, Romilda was condemned to\n",
      "the embraces of twelve Avars, and the third day the Lombard princess was\n",
      "impaled in the sight of the camp, while the chagan observed with a cruel\n",
      "smile, that such a husband was the fit recompense of her lewdness and\n",
      "perfidy. By these implacable enemies, Heraclius, on either side, was\n",
      "insulted and besieged: and the Roman empire was reduced to the walls of\n",
      "Constantinople, with the remnant of Greece, Italy, and Africa, and some\n",
      "maritime cities, from Tyre to Trebizond, of the Asiatic coast. After the\n",
      "loss of Egypt, the capital was afflicted by famine and pestilence;\n",
      "and the emperor, incapable of resistance, and hopeless of relief,\n",
      "had resolved to transfer his person and government to the more secure\n",
      "residence of Carthage. His ships were already laden with the treasures\n",
      "of the palace; but his flight was arrested by the patriarch, who armed\n",
      "the powers of religion in the defence of his country; led Heraclius to\n",
      "the altar of St. Sophia, and extorted a solemn oath, that he would live\n",
      "and die with the people whom God had intrusted to his care. The chagan\n",
      "was encamped in the plains of Thrace; but he dissembled his perfidious\n",
      "designs, and solicited an interview with the emperor near the town of\n",
      "Heraclea. Their reconciliation was celebrated with equestrian games; the\n",
      "senate and people, in their gayest apparel, resorted to the festival\n",
      "of peace; and the Avars beheld, with envy and desire, the spectacle of\n",
      "Roman luxury. On a sudden the hippodrome was encompassed by the\n",
      "Scythian cavalry, who had pressed their secret and nocturnal march: the\n",
      "tremendous sound of the chagan's whip gave the signal of the assault,\n",
      "and Heraclius, wrapping his diadem round his arm, was saved with extreme\n",
      "hazard, by the fleetness of his horse. So rapid was the pursuit, that\n",
      "the Avars almost entered the golden gate of Constantinople with the\n",
      "flying crowds: but the plunder of the suburbs rewarded their treason,\n",
      "and they transported beyond the Danube two hundred and seventy thousand\n",
      "captives. On the shore of Chalcedon, the emperor held a safer conference\n",
      "with a more honorable foe, who, before Heraclius descended from his\n",
      "galley, saluted with reverence and pity the majesty of the purple. The\n",
      "friendly offer of Sain, the Persian general, to conduct an embassy to\n",
      "the presence of the great king, was accepted with the warmest gratitude,\n",
      "and the prayer for pardon and peace was humbly presented by the\n",
      "PrÊtorian prÊfect, the prÊfect of the city, and one of the first\n",
      "ecclesiastics of the patriarchal church. But the lieutenant of Chosroes\n",
      "had fatally mistaken the intentions of his master. \"It was not an\n",
      "embassy,\" said the tyrant of Asia, \"it was the person of Heraclius,\n",
      "bound in chains, that he should have brought to the foot of my throne.\n",
      "I will never give peace to the emperor of Rome, till he had abjured his\n",
      "crucified God, and embraced the worship of the sun.\" Sain was flayed\n",
      "alive, according to the inhuman practice of his country; and the\n",
      "separate and rigorous confinement of the ambassadors violated the law of\n",
      "nations, and the faith of an express stipulation. Yet the experience\n",
      "of six years at length persuaded the Persian monarch to renounce the\n",
      "conquest of Constantinople, and to specify the annual tribute or ransom\n",
      "of the Roman empire; a thousand talents of gold, a thousand talents\n",
      "of silver, a thousand silk robes, a thousand horses, and a thousand\n",
      "virgins. Heraclius subscribed these ignominious terms; but the time and\n",
      "space which he obtained to collect such treasures from the poverty of\n",
      "the East, was industriously employed in the preparations of a bold and\n",
      "desperate attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the characters conspicuous in history, that of Heraclius is one of\n",
      "the most extraordinary and inconsistent. In the first and last years of\n",
      "a long reign, the emperor appears to be the slave of sloth, of pleasure,\n",
      "or of superstition, the careless and impotent spectator of the public\n",
      "calamities. But the languid mists of the morning and evening are\n",
      "separated by the brightness of the meridian sun; the Arcadius of the\n",
      "palace arose the CÊsar of the camp; and the honor of Rome and Heraclius\n",
      "was gloriously retrieved by the exploits and trophies of six adventurous\n",

      "the causes of his slumber and vigilance. At this distance we can\n",
      "only conjecture, that he was endowed with more personal courage than\n",
      "political resolution; that he was detained by the charms, and perhaps\n",
      "the arts, of his niece Martina, with whom, after the death of Eudocia,\n",
      "he contracted an incestuous marriage; and that he yielded to the base\n",
      "advice of the counsellors, who urged, as a fundamental law, that the\n",
      "life of the emperor should never be exposed in the field. Perhaps he was\n",
      "awakened by the last insolent demand of the Persian conqueror; but at\n",
      "the moment when Heraclius assumed the spirit of a hero, the only hopes\n",
      "of the Romans were drawn from the vicissitudes of fortune, which might\n",
      "threaten the proud prosperity of Chosroes, and must be favorable to\n",
      "those who had attained the lowest period of depression. To provide for\n",
      "the expenses of war, was the first care of the emperor; and for the\n",
      "purpose of collecting the tribute, he was allowed to solicit the\n",
      "benevolence of the eastern provinces. But the revenue no longer flowed\n",
      "in the usual channels; the credit of an arbitrary prince is annihilated\n",
      "by his power; and the courage of Heraclius was first displayed in daring\n",
      "to borrow the consecrated wealth of churches, under the solemn vow of\n",
      "restoring, with usury, whatever he had been compelled to employ in the\n",
      "service of religion and the empire. The clergy themselves appear to\n",
      "have sympathized with the public distress; and the discreet patriarch of\n",
      "Alexandria, without admitting the precedent of sacrilege, assisted\n",
      "his sovereign by the miraculous or seasonable revelation of a secret\n",
      "treasure. Of the soldiers who had conspired with Phocas, only two were\n",
      "found to have survived the stroke of time and of the Barbarians; the\n",
      "loss, even of these seditious veterans, was imperfectly supplied by the\n",
      "new levies of Heraclius, and the gold of the sanctuary united, in the\n",
      "same camp, the names, and arms, and languages of the East and West.\n",
      "He would have been content with the neutrality of the Avars; and his\n",
      "friendly entreaty, that the chagan would act, not as the enemy, but\n",
      "as the guardian, of the empire, was accompanied with a more persuasive\n",
      "donative of two hundred thousand pieces of gold. Two days after the\n",
      "festival of Easter, the emperor, exchanging his purple for the simple\n",
      "garb of a penitent and warrior, gave the signal of his departure. To the\n",
      "faith of the people Heraclius recommended his children; the civil\n",
      "and military powers were vested in the most deserving hands, and\n",
      "the discretion of the patriarch and senate was authorized to save or\n",
      "surrender the city, if they should be oppressed in his absence by the\n",
      "superior forces of the enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The neighboring heights of Chalcedon were covered with tents and arms:\n",
      "but if the new levies of Heraclius had been rashly led to the attack,\n",
      "the victory of the Persians in the sight of Constantinople might have\n",
      "been the last day of the Roman empire. As imprudent would it have been\n",
      "to advance into the provinces of Asia, leaving their innumerable cavalry\n",
      "to intercept his convoys, and continually to hang on the lassitude and\n",
      "disorder of his rear. But the Greeks were still masters of the sea;\n",
      "a fleet of galleys, transports, and store-ships, was assembled in the\n",
      "harbor; the Barbarians consented to embark; a steady wind carried them\n",
      "through the Hellespont the western and southern coast of Asia Minor lay\n",
      "on their left hand; the spirit of their chief was first displayed in a\n",
      "storm, and even the eunuchs of his train were excited to suffer and\n",
      "to work by the example of their master. He landed his troops on the\n",
      "confines of Syria and Cilicia, in the Gulf of Scanderoon, where the\n",
      "coast suddenly turns to the south; and his discernment was expressed\n",
      "in the choice of this important post. From all sides, the scattered\n",
      "garrisons of the maritime cities and the mountains might repair with\n",
      "speed and safety to his Imperial standard. The natural fortifications of\n",
      "Cilicia protected, and even concealed, the camp of Heraclius, which was\n",
      "pitched near Issus, on the same ground where Alexander had vanquished\n",
      "the host of Darius. The angle which the emperor occupied was deeply\n",
      "indented into a vast semicircle of the Asiatic, Armenian, and Syrian\n",
      "provinces; and to whatsoever point of the circumference he should direct\n",
      "his attack, it was easy for him to dissemble his own motions, and to\n",
      "prevent those of the enemy. In the camp of Issus, the Roman general\n",
      "reformed the sloth and disorder of the veterans, and educated the new\n",
      "recruits in the knowledge and practice of military virtue. Unfolding the\n",
      "miraculous image of Christ, he urged them to _revenge_ the holy altars\n",
      "which had been profaned by the worshippers of fire; addressing them by\n",
      "the endearing appellations of sons and brethren, he deplored the public\n",
      "and private wrongs of the republic. The subjects of a monarch were\n",
      "persuaded that they fought in the cause of freedom; and a similar\n",
      "enthusiasm was communicated to the foreign mercenaries, who must have\n",
      "viewed with equal indifference the interest of Rome and of Persia.\n",
      "Heraclius himself, with the skill and patience of a centurion,\n",
      "inculcated the lessons of the school of tactics, and the soldiers were\n",
      "assiduously trained in the use of their weapons, and the exercises and\n",
      "evolutions of the field. The cavalry and infantry in light or heavy\n",
      "armor were divided into two parties; the trumpets were fixed in the\n",
      "centre, and their signals directed the march, the charge, the retreat or\n",
      "pursuit; the direct or oblique order, the deep or extended phalanx; to\n",
      "represent in fictitious combat the operations of genuine war. Whatever\n",
      "hardships the emperor imposed on the troops, he inflicted with equal\n",
      "severity on himself; their labor, their diet, their sleep, were measured\n",
      "by the inflexible rules of discipline; and, without despising the enemy,\n",
      "they were taught to repose an implicit confidence in their own valor\n",
      "and the wisdom of their leader. Cilicia was soon encompassed with the\n",
      "Persian arms; but their cavalry hesitated to enter the defiles of Mount\n",
      "Taurus, till they were circumvented by the evolutions of Heraclius, who\n",
      "insensibly gained their rear, whilst he appeared to present his front in\n",
      "order of battle. By a false motion, which seemed to threaten Armenia, he\n",
      "drew them, against their wishes, to a general action. They were tempted\n",
      "by the artful disorder of his camp; but when they advanced to\n",
      "combat, the ground, the sun, and the expectation of both armies, were\n",
      "unpropitious to the Barbarians; the Romans successfully repeated their\n",
      "tactics in a field of battle, and the event of the day declared to\n",
      "the world, that the Persians were not invincible, and that a hero was\n",
      "invested with the purple. Strong in victory and fame, Heraclius boldly\n",
      "ascended the heights of Mount Taurus, directed his march through the\n",
      "plains of Cappadocia, and established his troops, for the winter season,\n",
      "in safe and plentiful quarters on the banks of the River Halys. His\n",
      "soul was superior to the vanity of entertaining Constantinople with an\n",
      "imperfect triumph; but the presence of the emperor was indispensably\n",
      "required to soothe the restless and rapacious spirit of the Avars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the days of Scipio and Hannibal, no bolder enterprise has been\n",
      "attempted than that which Heraclius achieved for the deliverance of the\n",
      "empire He permitted the Persians to oppress for a while the provinces,\n",
      "and to insult with impunity the capital of the East; while the Roman\n",
      "emperor explored his perilous way through the Black Sea, and the\n",
      "mountains of Armenia, penetrated into the heart of Persia, and recalled\n",
      "the armies of the great king to the defence of their bleeding country.\n",
      "With a select band of five thousand soldiers, Heraclius sailed from\n",
      "Constantinople to Trebizond; assembled his forces which had wintered\n",
      "in the Pontic regions; and, from the mouth of the Phasis to the Caspian\n",
      "Sea, encouraged his subjects and allies to march with the successor of\n",
      "Constantine under the faithful and victorious banner of the cross. When\n",
      "the legions of Lucullus and Pompey first passed the Euphrates, they\n",
      "blushed at their easy victory over the natives of Armenia. But the long\n",
      "experience of war had hardened the minds and bodies of that effeminate\n",
      "people; their zeal and bravery were approved in the service of a\n",
      "declining empire; they abhorred and feared the usurpation of the house\n",
      "of Sassan, and the memory of persecution envenomed their pious hatred\n",
      "of the enemies of Christ. The limits of Armenia, as it had been ceded to\n",
      "the emperor Maurice, extended as far as the Araxes: the river submitted\n",
      "to the indignity of a bridge, and Heraclius, in the footsteps of Mark\n",
      "Antony, advanced towards the city of Tauris or Gandzaca, the ancient and\n",
      "modern capital of one of the provinces of Media. At the head of forty\n",
      "thousand men, Chosroes himself had returned from some distant expedition\n",
      "to oppose the progress of the Roman arms; but he retreated on the\n",
      "approach of Heraclius, declining the generous alternative of peace or\n",
      "of battle. Instead of half a million of inhabitants, which have been\n",
      "ascribed to Tauris under the reign of the Sophys, the city contained no\n",
      "more than three thousand houses; but the value of the royal treasures\n",
      "was enhanced by a tradition, that they were the spoils of Crsus, which\n",
      "had been transported by Cyrus from the citadel of Sardes. The rapid\n",
      "conquests of Heraclius were suspended only by the winter season; a\n",
      "motive of prudence, or superstition, determined his retreat into the\n",
      "province of Albania, along the shores of the Caspian; and his tents were\n",
      "most probably pitched in the plains of Mogan, the favorite encampment of\n",
      "Oriental princes. In the course of this successful inroad, he signalized\n",
      "the zeal and revenge of a Christian emperor: at his command, the\n",
      "soldiers extinguished the fire, and destroyed the temples, of the Magi;\n",
      "the statues of Chosroes, who aspired to divine honors, were abandoned to\n",
      "the flames; and the ruins of Thebarma or Ormia, which had given birth\n",
      "to Zoroaster himself, made some atonement for the injuries of the\n",
      "holy sepulchre. A purer spirit of religion was shown in the relief and\n",
      "deliverance of fifty thousand captives. Heraclius was rewarded by their\n",
      "tears and grateful acclamations; but this wise measure, which spread the\n",
      "fame of his benevolence, diffused the murmurs of the Persians against\n",
      "the pride and obstinacy of their own sovereign.\n",

      "Amidst the glories of the succeeding campaign, Heraclius is almost lost\n",
      "to our eyes, and to those of the Byzantine historians. From the spacious\n",
      "and fruitful plains of Albania, the emperor appears to follow the chain\n",
      "of Hyrcanian Mountains, to descend into the province of Media or Irak,\n",
      "and to carry his victorious arms as far as the royal cities of Casbin\n",
      "and Ispahan, which had never been approached by a Roman conqueror.\n",
      "Alarmed by the danger of his kingdom, the powers of Chosroes were\n",
      "already recalled from the Nile and the Bosphorus, and three formidable\n",
      "armies surrounded, in a distant and hostile land, the camp of the\n",
      "emperor. The Colchian allies prepared to desert his standard; and the\n",
      "fears of the bravest veterans were expressed, rather than concealed,\n",
      "by their desponding silence. \"Be not terrified,\" said the intrepid\n",
      "Heraclius, \"by the multitude of your foes. With the aid of Heaven, one\n",
      "Roman may triumph over a thousand Barbarians. But if we devote our\n",
      "lives for the salvation of our brethren, we shall obtain the crown of\n",
      "martyrdom, and our immortal reward will be liberally paid by God and\n",
      "posterity.\" These magnanimous sentiments were supported by the vigor of\n",
      "his actions. He repelled the threefold attack of the Persians, improved\n",
      "the divisions of their chiefs, and, by a well-concerted train of\n",
      "marches, retreats, and successful actions, finally chased them from the\n",
      "field into the fortified cities of Media and Assyria. In the severity\n",
      "of the winter season, Sarbaraza deemed himself secure in the walls of\n",
      "Salban: he was surprised by the activity of Heraclius, who divided his\n",
      "troops, and performed a laborious march in the silence of the night. The\n",
      "flat roofs of the houses were defended with useless valor against the\n",
      "darts and torches of the Romans: the satraps and nobles of Persia, with\n",
      "their wives and children, and the flower of their martial youth, were\n",
      "either slain or made prisoners. The general escaped by a precipitate\n",
      "flight, but his golden armor was the prize of the conqueror; and the\n",
      "soldiers of Heraclius enjoyed the wealth and repose which they had so\n",
      "nobly deserved. On the return of spring, the emperor traversed in seven\n",
      "days the mountains of Curdistan, and passed without resistance the\n",
      "rapid stream of the Tigris. Oppressed by the weight of their spoils and\n",
      "captives, the Roman army halted under the walls of Amida; and Heraclius\n",
      "informed the senate of Constantinople of his safety and success, which\n",
      "they had already felt by the retreat of the besiegers. The bridges of\n",
      "the Euphrates were destroyed by the Persians; but as soon as the emperor\n",
      "had discovered a ford, they hastily retired to defend the banks of the\n",
      "Sarus, in Cilicia. That river, an impetuous torrent, was about three\n",
      "hundred feet broad; the bridge was fortified with strong turrets; and\n",
      "the banks were lined with Barbarian archers. After a bloody conflict,\n",
      "which continued till the evening, the Romans prevailed in the assault;\n",
      "and a Persian of gigantic size was slain and thrown into the Sarus\n",
      "by the hand of the emperor himself. The enemies were dispersed and\n",
      "dismayed; Heraclius pursued his march to Sebaste in Cappadocia; and at\n",
      "the expiration of three years, the same coast of the Euxine applauded\n",
      "his return from a long and victorious expedition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of skirmishing on the frontier, the two monarchs who disputed\n",
      "the empire of the East aimed their desperate strokes at the heart of\n",
      "their rival. The military force of Persia was wasted by the marches and\n",
      "combats of twenty years, and many of the veterans, who had survived\n",
      "the perils of the sword and the climate, were still detained in the\n",
      "fortresses of Egypt and Syria. But the revenge and ambition of Chosroes\n",
      "exhausted his kingdom; and the new levies of subjects, strangers, and\n",
      "slaves, were divided into three formidable bodies. The first army of\n",
      "fifty thousand men, illustrious by the ornament and title of the\n",
      "_golden spears_, was destined to march against Heraclius; the second\n",
      "was stationed to prevent his junction with the troops of his brother\n",
      "Theodore's; and the third was commanded to besiege Constantinople, and\n",
      "to second the operations of the chagan, with whom the Persian king had\n",
      "ratified a treaty of alliance and partition. Sarbar, the general of the\n",
      "third army, penetrated through the provinces of Asia to the well-known\n",
      "camp of Chalcedon, and amused himself with the destruction of the sacred\n",
      "and profane buildings of the Asiatic suburbs, while he impatiently\n",
      "waited the arrival of his Scythian friends on the opposite side of the\n",
      "Bosphorus. On the twenty-ninth of June, thirty thousand Barbarians, the\n",
      "vanguard of the Avars, forced the long wall, and drove into the capital\n",
      "a promiscuous crowd of peasants, citizens, and soldiers. Fourscore\n",
      "thousand of his native subjects, and of the vassal tribes of GepidÊ,\n",
      "Russians, Bulgarians, and Sclavonians, advanced under the standard of\n",

      "city was invested on the thirty-first of July, from the suburbs of\n",
      "Pera and Galata to the BlachernÊ and seven towers; and the inhabitants\n",
      "descried with terror the flaming signals of the European and Asiatic\n",
      "shores. In the mean while, the magistrates of Constantinople repeatedly\n",
      "strove to purchase the retreat of the chagan; but their deputies were\n",
      "rejected and insulted; and he suffered the patricians to stand before\n",
      "his throne, while the Persian envoys, in silk robes, were seated by his\n",
      "side. \"You see,\" said the haughty Barbarian, \"the proofs of my perfect\n",
      "union with the great king; and his lieutenant is ready to send into\n",
      "my camp a select band of three thousand warriors. Presume no longer to\n",
      "tempt your master with a partial and inadequate ransom your wealth and\n",
      "your city are the only presents worthy of my acceptance. For yourselves,\n",
      "I shall permit you to depart, each with an under-garment and a shirt;\n",
      "and, at my entreaty, my friend Sarbar will not refuse a passage through\n",
      "his lines. Your absent prince, even now a captive or a fugitive, has\n",
      "left Constantinople to its fate; nor can you escape the arms of the\n",
      "Avars and Persians, unless you could soar into the air like birds,\n",
      "unless like fishes you could dive into the waves.\" During ten successive\n",
      "days, the capital was assaulted by the Avars, who had made some progress\n",
      "in the science of attack; they advanced to sap or batter the wall,\n",
      "under the cover of the impenetrable tortoise; their engines discharged\n",
      "a perpetual volley of stones and darts; and twelve lofty towers of wood\n",
      "exalted the combatants to the height of the neighboring ramparts. But\n",
      "the senate and people were animated by the spirit of Heraclius, who\n",
      "had detached to their relief a body of twelve thousand cuirassiers; the\n",
      "powers of fire and mechanics were used with superior art and success in\n",
      "the defence of Constantinople; and the galleys, with two and three ranks\n",
      "of oars, commanded the Bosphorus, and rendered the Persians the idle\n",
      "spectators of the defeat of their allies. The Avars were repulsed; a\n",
      "fleet of Sclavonian canoes was destroyed in the harbor; the vassals\n",
      "of the chagan threatened to desert, his provisions were exhausted, and\n",
      "after burning his engines, he gave the signal of a slow and formidable\n",
      "retreat. The devotion of the Romans ascribed this signal deliverance to\n",
      "the Virgin Mary; but the mother of Christ would surely have condemned\n",
      "their inhuman murder of the Persian envoys, who were entitled to the\n",
      "rights of humanity, if they were not protected by the laws of nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the division of his army, Heraclius prudently retired to the banks\n",
      "of the Phasis, from whence he maintained a defensive war against the\n",
      "fifty thousand gold spears of Persia. His anxiety was relieved by the\n",
      "deliverance of Constantinople; his hopes were confirmed by a victory of\n",
      "his brother Theodorus; and to the hostile league of Chosroes with the\n",
      "Avars, the Roman emperor opposed the useful and honorable alliance of\n",
      "the Turks. At his liberal invitation, the horde of Chozars transported\n",
      "their tents from the plains of the Volga to the mountains of Georgia;\n",
      "Heraclius received them in the neighborhood of Teflis, and the khan with\n",
      "his nobles dismounted from their horses, if we may credit the Greeks,\n",
      "and fell prostrate on the ground, to adore the purple of the CÊsars.\n",
      "Such voluntary homage and important aid were entitled to the warmest\n",
      "acknowledgments; and the emperor, taking off his own diadem, placed it\n",
      "on the head of the Turkish prince, whom he saluted with a tender embrace\n",
      "and the appellation of son. After a sumptuous banquet, he presented\n",
      "Ziebel with the plate and ornaments, the gold, the gems, and the silk,\n",
      "which had been used at the Imperial table, and, with his own hand,\n",
      "distributed rich jewels and ear-rings to his new allies. In a\n",
      "secret interview, he produced the portrait of his daughter Eudocia,\n",
      "condescended to flatter the Barbarian with the promise of a fair and\n",
      "august bride; obtained an immediate succor of forty thousand horse, and\n",
      "negotiated a strong diversion of the Turkish arms on the side of the\n",
      "Oxus. The Persians, in their turn, retreated with precipitation; in the\n",
      "camp of Edessa, Heraclius reviewed an army of seventy thousand Romans\n",
      "and strangers; and some months were successfully employed in the\n",
      "recovery of the cities of Syria, Mesopotamia and Armenia, whose\n",
      "fortifications had been imperfectly restored. Sarbar still maintained\n",
      "the important station of Chalcedon; but the jealousy of Chosroes, or the\n",
      "artifice of Heraclius, soon alienated the mind of that powerful satrap\n",
      "from the service of his king and country. A messenger was intercepted\n",
      "with a real or fictitious mandate to the cadarigan, or second in\n",
      "command, directing him to send, without delay, to the throne, the head\n",
      "of a guilty or unfortunate general. The despatches were transmitted to\n",
      "Sarbar himself; and as soon as he read the sentence of his own death,\n",
      "he dexterously inserted the names of four hundred officers, assembled a\n",
      "military council, and asked the _cadarigan_ whether he was prepared to\n",
      "execute the commands of their tyrant. The Persians unanimously declared,\n",
      "that Chosroes had forfeited the sceptre; a separate treaty was concluded\n",
      "with the government of Constantinople; and if some considerations\n",
      "of honor or policy restrained Sarbar from joining the standard of\n",
      "Heraclius, the emperor was assured that he might prosecute, without\n",
      "interruption, his designs of victory and peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deprived of his firmest support, and doubtful of the fidelity of his\n",
      "subjects, the greatness of Chosroes was still conspicuous in its ruins.\n",
      "The number of five hundred thousand may be interpreted as an Oriental\n",
      "metaphor, to describe the men and arms, the horses and elephants, that\n",
      "covered Media and Assyria against the invasion of Heraclius. Yet the\n",
      "Romans boldly advanced from the Araxes to the Tigris, and the timid\n",
      "prudence of Rhazates was content to follow them by forced marches\n",
      "through a desolate country, till he received a peremptory mandate to\n",
      "risk the fate of Persia in a decisive battle. Eastward of the Tigris,\n",
      "at the end of the bridge of Mosul, the great Nineveh had formerly\n",
      "been erected: the city, and even the ruins of the city, had long\n",
      "since disappeared; the vacant space afforded a spacious field for the\n",
      "operations of the two armies. But these operations are neglected by the\n",
      "Byzantine historians, and, like the authors of epic poetry and romance,\n",
      "they ascribe the victory, not to the military conduct, but to the\n",
      "personal valor, of their favorite hero. On this memorable day,\n",
      "Heraclius, on his horse Phallas, surpassed the bravest of his warriors:\n",
      "his lip was pierced with a spear; the steed was wounded in the thigh;\n",
      "but he carried his master safe and victorious through the triple phalanx\n",
      "of the Barbarians. In the heat of the action, three valiant chiefs were\n",
      "successively slain by the sword and lance of the emperor: among these\n",
      "was Rhazates himself; he fell like a soldier, but the sight of his head\n",
      "scattered grief and despair through the fainting ranks of the Persians.\n",
      "His armor of pure and massy gold, the shield of one hundred and twenty\n",
      "plates, the sword and belt, the saddle and cuirass, adorned the triumph\n",
      "of Heraclius; and if he had not been faithful to Christ and his mother,\n",
      "the champion of Rome might have offered the fourth _opime_ spoils to\n",
      "the Jupiter of the Capitol. In the battle of Nineveh, which was fiercely\n",
      "fought from daybreak to the eleventh hour, twenty-eight standards,\n",
      "besides those which might be broken or torn, were taken from the\n",
      "Persians; the greatest part of their army was cut in pieces, and the\n",
      "victors, concealing their own loss, passed the night on the field. They\n",
      "acknowledged, that on this occasion it was less difficult to kill\n",
      "than to discomfit the soldiers of Chosroes; amidst the bodies of their\n",
      "friends, no more than two bow-shot from the enemy the remnant of the\n",
      "Persian cavalry stood firm till the seventh hour of the night; about\n",
      "the eighth hour they retired to their unrifled camp, collected their\n",
      "baggage, and dispersed on all sides, from the want of orders rather than\n",
      "of resolution. The diligence of Heraclius was not less admirable in\n",
      "the use of victory; by a march of forty-eight miles in four-and-twenty\n",
      "hours, his vanguard occupied the bridges of the great and the lesser\n",
      "Zab; and the cities and palaces of Assyria were open for the first\n",
      "time to the Romans. By a just gradation of magnificent scenes, they\n",
      "penetrated to the royal seat of Dastagerd, and, though much of the\n",
      "treasure had been removed, and much had been expended, the remaining\n",
      "wealth appears to have exceeded their hopes, and even to have satiated\n",
      "their avarice. Whatever could not be easily transported, they consumed\n",
      "with fire, that Chosroes might feel the anguish of those wounds which he\n",
      "had so often inflicted on the provinces of the empire: and justice might\n",
      "allow the excuse, if the desolation had been confined to the works of\n",
      "regal luxury, if national hatred, military license, and religious zeal,\n",
      "had not wasted with equal rage the habitations and the temples of the\n",
      "guiltless subject. The recovery of three hundred Roman standards, and\n",
      "the deliverance of the numerous captives of Edessa and Alexandria,\n",
      "reflect a purer glory on the arms of Heraclius. From the palace\n",
      "of Dastagerd, he pursued his march within a few miles of Modain or\n",
      "Ctesiphon, till he was stopped, on the banks of the Arba, by the\n",
      "difficulty of the passage, the rigor of the season, and perhaps the fame\n",
      "of an impregnable capital. The return of the emperor is marked by the\n",
      "modern name of the city of Sherhzour: he fortunately passed Mount\n",
      "Zara, before the snow, which fell incessantly thirty-four days; and the\n",
      "citizens of Gandzca, or Tauris, were compelled to entertain the soldiers\n",
      "and their horses with a hospitable reception.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the ambition of Chosroes was reduced to the defence of his\n",
      "hereditary kingdom, the love of glory, or even the sense of shame,\n",
      "should have urged him to meet his rival in the field. In the battle of\n",
      "Nineveh, his courage might have taught the Persians to vanquish, or\n",
      "he might have fallen with honor by the lance of a Roman emperor. The\n",
      "successor of Cyrus chose rather, at a secure distance, to expect the\n",
      "event, to assemble the relics of the defeat, and to retire, by measured\n",
      "steps, before the march of Heraclius, till he beheld with a sigh the\n",
      "once loved mansions of Dastagerd. Both his friends and enemies were\n",
      "persuaded, that it was the intention of Chosroes to bury himself under\n",
      "the ruins of the city and palace: and as both might have been equally\n",
      "adverse to his flight, the monarch of Asia, with Sira, and three\n",
      "concubines, escaped through a hole in the wall nine days before the\n",
      "arrival of the Romans. The slow and stately procession in which he\n",
      "showed himself to the prostrate crowd, was changed to a rapid and secret\n",
      "journey; and the first evening he lodged in the cottage of a peasant,\n",
      "whose humble door would scarcely give admittance to the great king. His\n",
      "superstition was subdued by fear: on the third day, he entered with joy\n",
      "the fortifications of Ctesiphon; yet he still doubted of his safety\n",
      "till he had opposed the River Tigris to the pursuit of the Romans. The\n",
      "discovery of his flight agitated with terror and tumult the palace, the\n",
      "city, and the camp of Dastagerd: the satraps hesitated whether they had\n",
      "most to fear from their sovereign or the enemy; and the females of the\n",
      "harem were astonished and pleased by the sight of mankind, till the\n",
      "jealous husband of three thousand wives again confined them to a more\n",
      "distant castle. At his command, the army of Dastagerd retreated to a\n",
      "new camp: the front was covered by the Arba, and a line of two hundred\n",
      "elephants; the troops of the more distant provinces successively\n",
      "arrived, and the vilest domestics of the king and satraps were enrolled\n",
      "for the last defence of the throne. It was still in the power of\n",
      "Chosroes to obtain a reasonable peace; and he was repeatedly pressed by\n",
      "the messengers of Heraclius to spare the blood of his subjects, and to\n",
      "relieve a humane conqueror from the painful duty of carrying fire\n",
      "and sword through the fairest countries of Asia. But the pride of the\n",
      "Persian had not yet sunk to the level of his fortune; he derived a\n",
      "momentary confidence from the retreat of the emperor; he wept with\n",
      "impotent rage over the ruins of his Assyrian palaces, and disregarded\n",
      "too long the rising murmurs of the nation, who complained that their\n",
      "lives and fortunes were sacrificed to the obstinacy of an old man. That\n",
      "unhappy old man was himself tortured with the sharpest pains both of\n",
      "mind and body; and, in the consciousness of his approaching end, he\n",
      "resolved to fix the tiara on the head of Merdaza, the most favored of\n",
      "his sons. But the will of Chosroes was no longer revered, and Siroes,\n",
      "who gloried in the rank and merit of his mother Sira, had conspired with\n",
      "the malecontents to assert and anticipate the rights of primogeniture.\n",
      "Twenty-two satraps (they styled themselves patriots) were tempted by the\n",
      "wealth and honors of a new reign: to the soldiers, the heir of Chosroes\n",
      "promised an increase of pay; to the Christians, the free exercise of\n",
      "their religion; to the captives, liberty and rewards; and to the nation,\n",
      "instant peace and the reduction of taxes. It was determined by the\n",
      "conspirators, that Siroes, with the ensigns of royalty, should appear in\n",
      "the camp; and if the enterprise should fail, his escape was contrived\n",
      "to the Imperial court. But the new monarch was saluted with unanimous\n",
      "acclamations; the flight of Chosroes (yet where could he have fled?) was\n",
      "rudely arrested, eighteen sons were massacred before his face, and he\n",
      "was thrown into a dungeon, where he expired on the fifth day. The Greeks\n",
      "and modern Persians minutely describe how Chosroes was insulted, and\n",
      "famished, and tortured, by the command of an inhuman son, who so far\n",
      "surpassed the example of his father: but at the time of his death, what\n",
      "tongue would relate the story of the parricide? what eye could penetrate\n",
      "into the _tower of darkness?_ According to the faith and mercy of his\n",
      "Christian enemies, he sunk without hope into a still deeper abyss; and\n",
      "it will not be denied, that tyrants of every age and sect are the best\n",
      "entitled to such infernal abodes. The glory of the house of Sassan ended\n",
      "with the life of Chosroes: his unnatural son enjoyed only eight months\n",
      "the fruit of his crimes: and in the space of four years, the regal title\n",
      "was assumed by nine candidates, who disputed, with the sword or dagger,\n",
      "the fragments of an exhausted monarchy. Every province, and each city of\n",
      "Persia, was the scene of independence, of discord, and of blood; and the\n",
      "state of anarchy prevailed about eight years longer, till the factions\n",
      "were silenced and united under the common yoke of the Arabian caliphs.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the mountains became passable, the emperor received the\n",
      "welcome news of the success of the conspiracy, the death of Chosroes,\n",
      "and the elevation of his eldest son to the throne of Persia. The authors\n",
      "of the revolution, eager to display their merits in the court or camp of\n",
      "Tauris, preceded the ambassadors of Siroes, who delivered the letters of\n",
      "their master to his _brother_ the emperor of the Romans. In the language\n",
      "of the usurpers of every age, he imputes his own crimes to the Deity,\n",
      "and, without degrading his equal majesty, he offers to reconcile the\n",
      "long discord of the two nations, by a treaty of peace and alliance more\n",
      "durable than brass or iron. The conditions of the treaty were easily\n",
      "defined and faithfully executed. In the recovery of the standards and\n",
      "prisoners which had fallen into the hands of the Persians, the emperor\n",
      "imitated the example of Augustus: their care of the national dignity\n",
      "was celebrated by the poets of the times, but the decay of genius may\n",
      "be measured by the distance between Horace and George of Pisidia: the\n",
      "subjects and brethren of Heraclius were redeemed from persecution,\n",
      "slavery, and exile; but, instead of the Roman eagles, the true wood of\n",
      "the holy cross was restored to the importunate demands of the successor\n",
      "of Constantine. The victor was not ambitious of enlarging the weakness\n",
      "of the empire; the son of Chosroes abandoned without regret the\n",
      "conquests of his father; the Persians who evacuated the cities of Syria\n",
      "and Egypt were honorably conducted to the frontier, and a war which had\n",
      "wounded the vitals of the two monarchies, produced no change in their\n",
      "external and relative situation. The return of Heraclius from Tauris to\n",
      "Constantinople was a perpetual triumph; and after the exploits of six\n",
      "glorious campaigns, he peaceably enjoyed the Sabbath of his toils. After\n",
      "a long impatience, the senate, the clergy, and the people, went forth\n",
      "to meet their hero, with tears and acclamations, with olive branches\n",
      "and innumerable lamps; he entered the capital in a chariot drawn by four\n",
      "elephants; and as soon as the emperor could disengage himself from\n",
      "the tumult of public joy, he tasted more genuine satisfaction in the\n",
      "embraces of his mother and his son.\n",
      "\n",
      "The succeeding year was illustrated by a triumph of a very different\n",
      "kind, the restitution of the true cross to the holy sepulchre. Heraclius\n",
      "performed in person the pilgrimage of Jerusalem, the identity of the\n",
      "relic was verified by the discreet patriarch, and this august ceremony\n",
      "has been commemorated by the annual festival of the exaltation of the\n",
      "cross. Before the emperor presumed to tread the consecrated ground, he\n",
      "was instructed to strip himself of the diadem and purple, the pomp and\n",
      "vanity of the world: but in the judgment of his clergy, the persecution\n",
      "of the Jews was more easily reconciled with the precepts of the gospel.\n",
      "* He again ascended his throne to receive the congratulations of the\n",
      "ambassadors of France and India: and the fame of Moses, Alexander, and\n",
      "Hercules, was eclipsed in the popular estimation, by the superior merit\n",
      "and glory of the great Heraclius. Yet the deliverer of the East was\n",
      "indigent and feeble. Of the Persian spoils, the most valuable portion\n",
      "had been expended in the war, distributed to the soldiers, or buried,\n",
      "by an unlucky tempest, in the waves of the Euxine. The conscience of the\n",
      "emperor was oppressed by the obligation of restoring the wealth of the\n",
      "clergy, which he had borrowed for their own defence: a perpetual fund\n",
      "was required to satisfy these inexorable creditors; the provinces,\n",
      "already wasted by the arms and avarice of the Persians, were compelled\n",
      "to a second payment of the same taxes; and the arrears of a simple\n",
      "citizen, the treasurer of Damascus, were commuted to a fine of one\n",
      "hundred thousand pieces of gold. The loss of two hundred thousand\n",
      "soldiers who had fallen by the sword, was of less fatal importance\n",
      "than the decay of arts, agriculture, and population, in this long and\n",
      "destructive war: and although a victorious army had been formed\n",
      "under the standard of Heraclius, the unnatural effort appears to have\n",
      "exhausted rather than exercised their strength. While the emperor\n",
      "triumphed at Constantinople or Jerusalem, an obscure town on the\n",
      "confines of Syria was pillaged by the Saracens, and they cut in pieces\n",
      "some troops who advanced to its relief; an ordinary and trifling\n",
      "occurrence, had it not been the prelude of a mighty revolution. These\n",
      "robbers were the apostles of Mahomet; their fanatic valor had emerged\n",
      "from the desert; and in the last eight years of his reign, Heraclius\n",
      "lost to the Arabs the same provinces which he had rescued from the\n",

      "After the extinction of paganism, the Christians in peace and piety\n",
      "might have enjoyed their solitary triumph. But the principle of discord\n",
      "was alive in their bosom, and they were more solicitous to explore the\n",
      "nature, than to practice the laws, of their founder. I have already\n",
      "observed, that the disputes of the Trinity were succeeded by those of\n",

      "I. A laudable regard for the honor of the first proselyte has\n",
      "countenanced the belief, the hope, the wish, that the Ebionites, or\n",
      "at least the Nazarenes, were distinguished only by their obstinate\n",
      "perseverance in the practice of the Mosaic rites. Their churches have\n",
      "disappeared, their books are obliterated: their obscure freedom might\n",
      "allow a latitude of faith, and the softness of their infant creed would\n",
      "be variously moulded by the zeal or prudence of three hundred years. Yet\n",
      "the most charitable criticism must refuse these sectaries any knowledge\n",
      "of the pure and proper divinity of Christ. Educated in the school of\n",
      "Jewish prophecy and prejudice, they had never been taught to elevate\n",
      "their hopes above a human and temporal Messiah. If they had courage\n",
      "to hail their king when he appeared in a plebeian garb, their grosser\n",
      "apprehensions were incapable of discerning their God, who had studiously\n",
      "disguised his celestial character under the name and person of a mortal.\n",
      "The familiar companions of Jesus of Nazareth conversed with their friend\n",
      "and countryman, who, in all the actions of rational and animal life,\n",
      "appeared of the same species with themselves. His progress from infancy\n",
      "to youth and manhood was marked by a regular increase in stature and\n",
      "wisdom; and after a painful agony of mind and body, he expired on the\n",
      "cross. He lived and died for the service of mankind: but the life and\n",
      "death of Socrates had likewise been devoted to the cause of religion\n",
      "and justice; and although the stoic or the hero may disdain the humble\n",
      "virtues of Jesus, the tears which he shed over his friend and country\n",
      "may be esteemed the purest evidence of his humanity. The miracles of the\n",
      "gospel could not astonish a people who held with intrepid faith the more\n",
      "splendid prodigies of the Mosaic law. The prophets of ancient days had\n",
      "cured diseases, raised the dead, divided the sea, stopped the sun, and\n",
      "ascended to heaven in a fiery chariot. And the metaphorical style of the\n",
      "Hebrews might ascribe to a saint and martyr the adoptive title of Son of\n",
      "God.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet in the insufficient creed of the Nazarenes and the Ebionites, a\n",
      "distinction is faintly noticed between the heretics, who confounded the\n",
      "generation of Christ in the common order of nature, and the less guilty\n",
      "schismatics, who revered the virginity of his mother, and excluded the\n",
      "aid of an earthly father. The incredulity of the former was countenanced\n",
      "by the visible circumstances of his birth, the legal marriage of the\n",
      "reputed parents, Joseph and Mary, and his lineal claim to the kingdom of\n",
      "David and the inheritance of Judah. But the secret and authentic history\n",
      "has been recorded in several copies of the Gospel according to St.\n",
      "Matthew, which these sectaries long preserved in the original Hebrew, as\n",
      "the sole evidence of their faith. The natural suspicions of the husband,\n",
      "conscious of his own chastity, were dispelled by the assurance (in a\n",
      "dream) that his wife was pregnant of the Holy Ghost: and as this distant\n",
      "and domestic prodigy could not fall under the personal observation of\n",
      "the historian, he must have listened to the same voice which dictated to\n",
      "Isaiah the future conception of a virgin. The son of a virgin, generated\n",
      "by the ineffable operation of the Holy Spirit, was a creature without\n",
      "example or resemblance, superior in every attribute of mind and body to\n",
      "the children of Adam. Since the introduction of the Greek or Chaldean\n",
      "philosophy, the Jews were persuaded of the preexistence, transmigration,\n",
      "and immortality of souls; and providence was justified by a supposition,\n",
      "that they were confined in their earthly prisons to expiate the stains\n",
      "which they had contracted in a former state. But the degrees of purity\n",
      "and corruption are almost immeasurable. It might be fairly presumed,\n",
      "that the most sublime and virtuous of human spirits was infused into the\n",
      "offspring of Mary and the Holy Ghost; that his abasement was the result\n",
      "of his voluntary choice; and that the object of his mission was, to\n",
      "purify, not his own, but the sins of the world. On his return to his\n",
      "native skies, he received the immense reward of his obedience; the\n",
      "everlasting kingdom of the Messiah, which had been darkly foretold by\n",
      "the prophets, under the carnal images of peace, of conquest, and of\n",
      "dominion. Omnipotence could enlarge the human faculties of Christ to the\n",
      "extend of is celestial office. In the language of antiquity, the title\n",
      "of God has not been severely confined to the first parent, and his\n",
      "incomparable minister, his only-begotten son, might claim, without\n",
      "presumption, the religious, though secondary, worship of a subject of a\n",

      "II. The seeds of the faith, which had slowly arisen in the rocky and\n",
      "ungrateful soil of Judea, were transplanted, in full maturity, to the\n",
      "happier climes of the Gentiles; and the strangers of Rome or Asia, who\n",
      "never beheld the manhood, were the more readily disposed to embrace the\n",
      "divinity, of Christ. The polytheist and the philosopher, the Greek and\n",
      "the Barbarian, were alike accustomed to conceive a long succession, an\n",
      "infinite chain of angels or dÊmons, or deities, or Êons, or emanations,\n",
      "issuing from the throne of light. Nor could it seem strange or\n",
      "incredible, that the first of these Êons, the _Logos_, or Word of God,\n",
      "of the same substance with the Father, should descend upon earth, to\n",
      "deliver the human race from vice and error, and to conduct them in\n",
      "the paths of life and immortality. But the prevailing doctrine of the\n",
      "eternity and inherent pravity of matter infected the primitive churches\n",
      "of the East. Many among the Gentile proselytes refused to believe that\n",
      "a celestial spirit, an undivided portion of the first essence, had been\n",
      "personally united with a mass of impure and contaminated flesh; and,\n",
      "in their zeal for the divinity, they piously abjured the humanity,\n",
      "of Christ. While his blood was still recent on Mount Calvary, the\n",
      "_Docetes_, a numerous and learned sect of Asiatics, invented the\n",
      "_phantastic_ system, which was afterwards propagated by the Marcionites,\n",
      "the ManichÊans, and the various names of the Gnostic heresy. They denied\n",
      "the truth and authenticity of the Gospels, as far as they relate the\n",
      "conception of Mary, the birth of Christ, and the thirty years that\n",
      "preceded the exercise of his ministry. He first appeared on the banks of\n",
      "the Jordan in the form of perfect manhood; but it was a form only, and\n",
      "not a substance; a human figure created by the hand of Omnipotence to\n",
      "imitate the faculties and actions of a man, and to impose a perpetual\n",
      "illusion on the senses of his friends and enemies. Articulate sounds\n",
      "vibrated on the ears of the disciples; but the image which was impressed\n",
      "on their optic nerve eluded the more stubborn evidence of the touch; and\n",
      "they enjoyed the spiritual, not the corporeal, presence of the Son of\n",
      "God. The rage of the Jews was idly wasted against an impassive phantom;\n",
      "and the mystic scenes of the passion and death, the resurrection and\n",
      "ascension, of Christ were represented on the theatre of Jerusalem for\n",
      "the benefit of mankind. If it were urged, that such ideal mimicry,\n",
      "such incessant deception, was unworthy of the God of truth, the Docetes\n",
      "agreed with too many of their orthodox brethren in the justification of\n",
      "pious falsehood. In the system of the Gnostics, the Jehovah of Israel,\n",
      "the Creator of this lower world, was a rebellious, or at least an\n",
      "ignorant, spirit. The Son of God descended upon earth to abolish his\n",
      "temple and his law; and, for the accomplishment of this salutary end, he\n",
      "dexterously transferred to his own person the hope and prediction of a\n",

      "One of the most subtile disputants of the ManichÊan school has pressed\n",
      "the danger and indecency of supposing, that the God of the Christians,\n",
      "in the state of a human ftus, emerged at the end of nine months from\n",
      "a female womb. The pious horror of his antagonists provoked them to\n",
      "disclaim all sensual circumstances of conception and delivery; to\n",
      "maintain that the divinity passed through Mary like a sunbeam through a\n",
      "plate of glass; and to assert, that the seal of her virginity remained\n",
      "unbroken even at the moment when she became the mother of Christ. But\n",
      "the rashness of these concessions has encouraged a milder sentiment of\n",
      "those of the Docetes, who taught, not that Christ was a phantom, but\n",
      "that he was clothed with an impassible and incorruptible body.\n",
      "Such, indeed, in the more orthodox system, he has acquired since his\n",

      "stains of sensual concupiscence. Of a body thus singularly constituted,\n",
      "a question would arise, by what means, and of what materials, it was\n",
      "originally framed; and our sounder theology is startled by an answer\n",
      "which was not peculiar to the Gnostics, that both the form and the\n",
      "substance proceeded from the divine essence. The idea of pure and\n",
      "absolute spirit is a refinement of modern philosophy: the incorporeal\n",
      "essence, ascribed by the ancients to human souls, celestial beings, and\n",
      "even the Deity himself, does not exclude the notion of extended space;\n",
      "and their imagination was satisfied with a subtile nature of air, or\n",
      "fire, or Êther, incomparably more perfect than the grossness of the\n",
      "material world. If we define the place, we must describe the figure, of\n",
      "the Deity. Our experience, perhaps our vanity, represents the powers of\n",
      "reason and virtue under a human form. The Anthropomorphites, who swarmed\n",
      "among the monks of Egypt and the Catholics of Africa, could produce the\n",
      "express declaration of Scripture, that man was made after the image of\n",
      "his Creator. The venerable Serapion, one of the saints of the Nitrian\n",
      "deserts, relinquished, with many a tear, his darling prejudice; and\n",
      "bewailed, like an infant, his unlucky conversion, which had stolen\n",

      "III. Such were the fleeting shadows of the Docetes. A more substantial,\n",
      "though less simple, hypothesis, was contrived by Cerinthus of Asia, who\n",
      "dared to oppose the last of the apostles. Placed on the confines of the\n",
      "Jewish and Gentile world, he labored to reconcile the Gnostic with the\n",
      "Ebionite, by confessing in the same Messiah the supernatural union of a\n",
      "man and a God; and this mystic doctrine was adopted with many fanciful\n",
      "improvements by Carpocrates, Basilides, and Valentine, the heretics of\n",
      "the Egyptian school. In their eyes, Jesus of Nazareth was a mere mortal,\n",
      "the legitimate son of Joseph and Mary: but he was the best and wisest of\n",
      "the human race, selected as the worthy instrument to restore upon earth\n",
      "the worship of the true and supreme Deity. When he was baptized in\n",
      "the Jordan, the Christ, the first of the Êons, the Son of God himself,\n",
      "descended on Jesus in the form of a dove, to inhabit his mind, and\n",
      "direct his actions during the allotted period of his ministry. When\n",
      "the Messiah was delivered into the hands of the Jews, the Christ, an\n",
      "immortal and impassible being, forsook his earthly tabernacle, flew back\n",
      "to the _pleroma_ or world of spirits, and left the solitary Jesus to\n",
      "suffer, to complain, and to expire. But the justice and generosity of\n",
      "such a desertion are strongly questionable; and the fate of an innocent\n",
      "martyr, at first impelled, and at length abandoned, by his divine\n",
      "companion, might provoke the pity and indignation of the profane.\n",
      "Their murmurs were variously silenced by the sectaries who espoused and\n",
      "modified the double system of Cerinthus. It was alleged, that when Jesus\n",
      "was nailed to the cross, he was endowed with a miraculous apathy of mind\n",
      "and body, which rendered him insensible of his apparent sufferings.\n",
      "It was affirmed, that these momentary, though real, pangs would be\n",
      "abundantly repaid by the temporal reign of a thousand years reserved for\n",
      "the Messiah in his kingdom of the new Jerusalem. It was insinuated,\n",
      "that if he suffered, he deserved to suffer; that human nature is never\n",
      "absolutely perfect; and that the cross and passion might serve to\n",
      "expiate the venial transgressions of the son of Joseph, before his\n",
      "mysterious union with the Son of God.\n",

      "IV. All those who believe the immateriality of the soul, a specious\n",
      "and noble tenet, must confess, from their present experience, the\n",
      "incomprehensible union of mind and matter. A similar union is not\n",
      "inconsistent with a much higher, or even with the highest, degree of\n",
      "mental faculties; and the incarnation of an Êon or archangel, the most\n",
      "perfect of created spirits, does not involve any positive contradiction\n",
      "or absurdity. In the age of religious freedom, which was determined\n",
      "by the council of Nice, the dignity of Christ was measured by private\n",
      "judgment according to the indefinite rule of Scripture, or reason, or\n",
      "tradition. But when his pure and proper divinity had been established on\n",
      "the ruins of Arianism, the faith of the Catholics trembled on the edge\n",
      "of a precipice where it was impossible to recede, dangerous to stand,\n",
      "dreadful to fall and the manifold inconveniences of their creed were\n",
      "aggravated by the sublime character of their theology. They hesitated\n",
      "to pronounce; _that_ God himself, the second person of an equal and\n",
      "consubstantial trinity, was manifested in the flesh; _that_ a being who\n",
      "pervades the universe, had been confined in the womb of Mary; _that_ his\n",
      "eternal duration had been marked by the days, and months, and years of\n",
      "human existence; _that_ the Almighty had been scourged and crucified;\n",
      "_that_ his impassible essence had felt pain and anguish; _that_ his\n",
      "omniscience was not exempt from ignorance; and that the source of life\n",
      "and immortality expired on Mount Calvary. These alarming consequences\n",
      "were affirmed with unblushing simplicity by Apollinaris, bishop of\n",
      "Laodicea, and one of the luminaries of the church. The son of a learned\n",
      "grammarian, he was skilled in all the sciences of Greece; eloquence,\n",
      "erudition, and philosophy, conspicuous in the volumes of Apollinaris,\n",
      "were humbly devoted to the service of religion. The worthy friend of\n",
      "Athanasius, the worthy antagonist of Julian, he bravely wrestled\n",
      "with the Arians and Polytheists, and though he affected the rigor of\n",
      "geometrical demonstration, his commentaries revealed the literal and\n",
      "allegorical sense of the Scriptures. A mystery, which had long floated\n",
      "in the looseness of popular belief, was defined by his perverse\n",
      "diligence in a technical form; and he first proclaimed the memorable\n",
      "words, \"One incarnate nature of Christ,\" which are still reÎchoed with\n",
      "hostile clamors in the churches of Asia, Egypt, and ∆thiopia. He taught\n",
      "that the Godhead was united or mingled with the body of a man; and that\n",
      "the _Logos_, the eternal wisdom, supplied in the flesh the place and\n",
      "office of a human soul. Yet as the profound doctor had been terrified at\n",
      "his own rashness, Apollinaris was heard to mutter some faint accents\n",
      "of excuse and explanation. He acquiesced in the old distinction of the\n",
      "Greek philosophers between the rational and sensitive soul of man; that\n",
      "he might reserve the _Logos_ for intellectual functions, and employ the\n",
      "subordinate human principle in the meaner actions of animal life. With\n",
      "the moderate Docetes, he revered Mary as the spiritual, rather than\n",
      "as the carnal, mother of Christ, whose body either came from heaven,\n",
      "impassible and incorruptible, or was absorbed, and as it were\n",
      "transformed, into the essence of the Deity. The system of Apollinaris\n",
      "was strenuously encountered by the Asiatic and Syrian divines whose\n",
      "schools are honored by the names of Basil, Gregory and Chrysostom, and\n",
      "tainted by those of Diodorus, Theodore, and Nestorius. But the person\n",
      "of the aged bishop of Laodicea, his character and dignity, remained\n",
      "inviolate; and his rivals, since we may not suspect them of the weakness\n",
      "of toleration, were astonished, perhaps, by the novelty of the argument,\n",
      "and diffident of the final sentence of the Catholic church. Her judgment\n",
      "at length inclined in their favor; the heresy of Apollinaris was\n",
      "condemned, and the separate congregations of his disciples were\n",
      "proscribed by the Imperial laws. But his principles were secretly\n",
      "entertained in the monasteries of Egypt, and his enemies felt the hatred\n",
      "of Theophilus and Cyril, the successive patriarchs of Alexandria.\n",
      "\n",
      "V. The grovelling Ebionite, and the fantastic Docetes, were rejected and\n",
      "forgotten: the recent zeal against the errors of Apollinaris reduced the\n",
      "Catholics to a seeming agreement with the double nature of Cerinthus.\n",
      "But instead of a temporary and occasional alliance, _they_ established,\n",
      "and we still embrace, the substantial, indissoluble, and everlasting\n",
      "union of a perfect God with a perfect man, of the second person of the\n",
      "trinity with a reasonable soul and human flesh. In the beginning of\n",
      "the fifth century, the _unity_ of the _two natures_ was the prevailing\n",
      "doctrine of the church. On all sides, it was confessed, that the mode\n",
      "of their coexistence could neither be represented by our ideas, nor\n",
      "expressed by our language. Yet a secret and incurable discord was\n",
      "cherished, between those who were most apprehensive of confounding,\n",
      "and those who were most fearful of separating, the divinity, and the\n",
      "humanity, of Christ. Impelled by religious frenzy, they fled with\n",
      "adverse haste from the error which they mutually deemed most destructive\n",
      "of truth and salvation. On either hand they were anxious to guard,\n",
      "they were jealous to defend, the union and the distinction of the two\n",
      "natures, and to invent such forms of speech, such symbols of doctrine,\n",
      "as were least susceptible of doubt or ambiguity. The poverty of ideas\n",
      "and language tempted them to ransack art and nature for every possible\n",
      "comparison, and each comparison mislead their fancy in the explanation\n",
      "of an incomparable mystery. In the polemic microscope, an atom is\n",
      "enlarged to a monster, and each party was skilful to exaggerate the\n",
      "absurd or impious conclusions that might be extorted from the principles\n",
      "of their adversaries. To escape from each other, they wandered through\n",
      "many a dark and devious thicket, till they were astonished by the horrid\n",
      "phantoms of Cerinthus and Apollinaris, who guarded the opposite issues\n",
      "of the theological labyrinth. As soon as they beheld the twilight of\n",
      "sense and heresy, they started, measured back their steps, and were\n",
      "again involved in the gloom of impenetrable orthodoxy. To purge\n",
      "themselves from the guilt or reproach of damnable error, they\n",
      "disavowed their consequences, explained their principles, excused their\n",
      "indiscretions, and unanimously pronounced the sounds of concord and\n",
      "faith. Yet a latent and almost invisible spark still lurked among the\n",
      "embers of controversy: by the breath of prejudice and passion, it\n",
      "was quickly kindled to a mighty flame, and the verbal disputes of the\n",
      "Oriental sects have shaken the pillars of the church and state.\n",
      "\n",
      "The name of Cyril of Alexandria is famous in controversial story, and\n",
      "the title of _saint_ is a mark that his opinions and his party have\n",
      "finally prevailed. In the house of his uncle, the archbishop Theophilus,\n",
      "he imbibed the orthodox lessons of zeal and dominion, and five years of\n",
      "his youth were profitably spent in the adjacent monasteries of\n",
      "Nitria. Under the tuition of the abbot Serapion, he applied himself\n",
      "to ecclesiastical studies, with such indefatigable ardor, that in the\n",
      "course of _one_ sleepless night, he has perused the four Gospels, the\n",
      "Catholic Epistles, and the Epistle to the Romans. Origen he detested;\n",
      "but the writings of Clemens and Dionysius, of Athanasius and Basil, were\n",
      "continually in his hands: by the theory and practice of dispute, his\n",
      "faith was confirmed and his wit was sharpened; he extended round his\n",
      "cell the cobwebs of scholastic theology, and meditated the works of\n",
      "allegory and metaphysics, whose remains, in seven verbose folios, now\n",
      "peaceably slumber by the side of their rivals. Cyril prayed and fasted\n",
      "in the desert, but his thoughts (it is the reproach of a friend) were\n",
      "still fixed on the world; and the call of Theophilus, who summoned\n",
      "him to the tumult of cities and synods, was too readily obeyed by the\n",
      "aspiring hermit. With the approbation of his uncle, he assumed the\n",
      "office, and acquired the fame, of a popular preacher. His comely person\n",
      "adorned the pulpit; the harmony of his voice resounded in the cathedral;\n",
      "his friends were stationed to lead or second the applause of the\n",
      "congregation; and the hasty notes of the scribes preserved his\n",
      "discourses, which in their effect, though not in their composition,\n",
      "might be compared with those of the Athenian orators. The death of\n",
      "Theophilus expanded and realized the hopes of his nephew. The clergy\n",

      "claims of the archdeacon; but a resistless multitude, with voices and\n",
      "with hands, asserted the cause of their favorite; and after a period of\n",

      "The prize was not unworthy of his ambition. At a distance from the\n",
      "court, and at the head of an immense capital, the patriarch, as he was\n",
      "now styled, of Alexandria had gradually usurped the state and authority\n",
      "of a civil magistrate. The public and private charities of the city were\n",
      "blindly obeyed by his numerous and fanatic _parabolani_, familiarized in\n",
      "their daily office with scenes of death; and the prÊfects of Egypt were\n",
      "awed or provoked by the temporal power of these Christian pontiffs.\n",
      "Ardent in the prosecution of heresy, Cyril auspiciously opened his\n",
      "reign by oppressing the Novatians, the most innocent and harmless of the\n",
      "sectaries. The interdiction of their religious worship appeared in his\n",
      "eyes a just and meritorious act; and he confiscated their holy vessels,\n",
      "without apprehending the guilt of sacrilege. The toleration, and even\n",
      "the privileges of the Jews, who had multiplied to the number of forty\n",
      "thousand, were secured by the laws of the CÊsars and Ptolemies, and\n",
      "a long prescription of seven hundred years since the foundation of\n",
      "Alexandria. Without any legal sentence, without any royal mandate, the\n",
      "patriarch, at the dawn of day, led a seditious multitude to the attack\n",
      "of the synagogues. Unarmed and unprepared, the Jews were incapable of\n",
      "resistance; their houses of prayer were levelled with the ground, and\n",
      "the episcopal warrior, after-rewarding his troops with the plunder\n",
      "of their goods, expelled from the city the remnant of the unbelieving\n",
      "nation. Perhaps he might plead the insolence of their prosperity, and\n",
      "their deadly hatred of the Christians, whose blood they had recently\n",
      "shed in a malicious or accidental tumult. Such crimes would have\n",
      "deserved the animadversion of the magistrate; but in this promiscuous\n",
      "outrage, the innocent were confounded with the guilty, and Alexandria\n",
      "was impoverished by the loss of a wealthy and industrious colony. The\n",
      "zeal of Cyril exposed him to the penalties of the Julian law; but in a\n",
      "feeble government and a superstitious age, he was secure of impunity,\n",
      "and even of praise. Orestes complained; but his just complaints were\n",
      "too quickly forgotten by the ministers of Theodosius, and too deeply\n",
      "remembered by a priest who affected to pardon, and continued to hate,\n",
      "the prÊfect of Egypt. As he passed through the streets, his chariot was\n",
      "assaulted by a band of five hundred of the Nitrian monks his guards\n",
      "fled from the wild beasts of the desert; his protestations that he was\n",
      "a Christian and a Catholic were answered by a volley of stones, and the\n",
      "face of Orestes was covered with blood. The loyal citizens of Alexandria\n",
      "hastened to his rescue; he instantly satisfied his justice and revenge\n",
      "against the monk by whose hand he had been wounded, and Ammonius expired\n",
      "under the rod of the lictor. At the command of Cyril his body was\n",
      "raised from the ground, and transported, in solemn procession, to the\n",
      "cathedral; the name of Ammonius was changed to that of Thaumasius the\n",
      "_wonderful_; his tomb was decorated with the trophies of martyrdom, and\n",
      "the patriarch ascended the pulpit to celebrate the magnanimity of an\n",
      "assassin and a rebel. Such honors might incite the faithful to combat\n",
      "and die under the banners of the saint; and he soon prompted, or\n",
      "accepted, the sacrifice of a virgin, who professed the religion of the\n",
      "Greeks, and cultivated the friendship of Orestes. Hypatia, the daughter\n",
      "of Theon the mathematician, was initiated in her father's studies;\n",
      "her learned comments have elucidated the geometry of Apollonius and\n",
      "Diophantus, and she publicly taught, both at Athens and Alexandria, the\n",
      "philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. In the bloom of beauty, and in the\n",
      "maturity of wisdom, the modest maid refused her lovers and instructed\n",
      "her disciples; the persons most illustrious for their rank or merit\n",
      "were impatient to visit the female philosopher; and Cyril beheld, with\n",
      "a jealous eye, the gorgeous train of horses and slaves who crowded the\n",
      "door of her academy. A rumor was spread among the Christians, that the\n",
      "daughter of Theon was the only obstacle to the reconciliation of the\n",
      "prÊfect and the archbishop; and that obstacle was speedily removed. On\n",
      "a fatal day, in the holy season of Lent, Hypatia was torn from her\n",
      "chariot, stripped naked, dragged to the church, and inhumanly butchered\n",
      "by the hands of Peter the reader, and a troop of savage and merciless\n",
      "fanatics: her flesh was scraped from her bones with sharp oyster shells,\n",
      "and her quivering limbs were delivered to the flames. The just progress\n",
      "of inquiry and punishment was stopped by seasonable gifts; but the\n",
      "murder of Hypatia has imprinted an indelible stain on the character and\n",
      "religion of Cyril of Alexandria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Superstition, perhaps, would more gently expiate the blood of a virgin,\n",
      "than the banishment of a saint; and Cyril had accompanied his uncle\n",
      "to the iniquitous synod of the Oak. When the memory of Chrysostom was\n",
      "restored and consecrated, the nephew of Theophilus, at the head of a\n",
      "dying faction, still maintained the justice of his sentence; nor was it\n",
      "till after a tedious delay and an obstinate resistance, that he yielded\n",
      "to the consent of the Catholic world. His enmity to the Byzantine\n",
      "pontiffs was a sense of interest, not a sally of passion: he envied\n",
      "their fortunate station in the sunshine of the Imperial court; and he\n",
      "dreaded their upstart ambition, which oppressed the metropolitans of\n",
      "Europe and Asia, invaded the provinces of Antioch and Alexandria, and\n",
      "measured their diocese by the limits of the empire. The long moderation\n",
      "of Atticus, the mild usurper of the throne of Chrysostom, suspended the\n",
      "animosities of the Eastern patriarchs; but Cyril was at length awakened\n",
      "by the exaltation of a rival more worthy of his esteem and hatred. After\n",
      "the short and troubled reign of Sisinnius, bishop of Constantinople,\n",
      "the factions of the clergy and people were appeased by the choice of the\n",
      "emperor, who, on this occasion, consulted the voice of fame, and invited\n",
      "the merit of a stranger. Nestorius, native of Germanicia, and a monk of\n",
      "Antioch, was recommended by the austerity of his life, and the eloquence\n",
      "of his sermons; but the first homily which he preached before the devout\n",
      "Theodosius betrayed the acrimony and impatience of his zeal. \"Give me, O\n",
      "CÊsar!\" he exclaimed, \"give me the earth purged of heretics, and I will\n",
      "give you in exchange the kingdom of heaven. Exterminate with me the\n",
      "heretics; and with you I will exterminate the Persians.\" On the\n",
      "fifth day as if the treaty had been already signed, the patriarch of\n",
      "Constantinople discovered, surprised, and attacked a secret conventicle\n",
      "of the Arians: they preferred death to submission; the flames that were\n",
      "kindled by their despair, soon spread to the neighboring houses, and the\n",
      "triumph of Nestorius was clouded by the name of _incendiary_. On either\n",
      "side of the Hellespont his episcopal vigor imposed a rigid formulary of\n",
      "faith and discipline; a chronological error concerning the festival of\n",
      "Easter was punished as an offence against the church and state. Lydia\n",
      "and Caria, Sardes and Miletus, were purified with the blood of the\n",
      "obstinate Quartodecimans; and the edict of the emperor, or rather of the\n",
      "patriarch, enumerates three-and-twenty degrees and denominations in\n",
      "the guilt and punishment of heresy. But the sword of persecution which\n",
      "Nestorius so furiously wielded was soon turned against his own breast.\n",
      "Religion was the pretence; but, in the judgment of a contemporary saint,\n",
      "ambition was the genuine motive of episcopal warfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Syrian school, Nestorius had been taught to abhor the confusion\n",
      "of the two natures, and nicely to discriminate the humanity of his\n",
      "_master_ Christ from the divinity of the _Lord_ Jesus. The Blessed\n",
      "Virgin he revered as the mother of Christ, but his ears were offended\n",
      "with the rash and recent title of mother of God, which had been\n",
      "insensibly adopted since the origin of the Arian controversy. From the\n",
      "pulpit of Constantinople, a friend of the patriarch, and afterwards the\n",
      "patriarch himself, repeatedly preached against the use, or the abuse,\n",
      "of a word unknown to the apostles, unauthorized by the church, and which\n",
      "could only tend to alarm the timorous, to mislead the simple, to amuse\n",
      "the profane, and to justify, by a seeming resemblance, the old genealogy\n",
      "of Olympus. In his calmer moments Nestorius confessed, that it might\n",
      "be tolerated or excused by the union of the two natures, and\n",
      "the communication of their _idioms_: but he was exasperated, by\n",
      "contradiction, to disclaim the worship of a new-born, an infant Deity,\n",
      "to draw his inadequate similes from the conjugal or civil partnerships\n",
      "of life, and to describe the manhood of Christ as the robe, the\n",
      "instrument, the tabernacle of his Godhead. At these blasphemous sounds,\n",
      "the pillars of the sanctuary were shaken. The unsuccessful competitors\n",
      "of Nestorius indulged their pious or personal resentment, the Byzantine\n",
      "clergy was secretly displeased with the intrusion of a stranger:\n",
      "whatever is superstitious or absurd, might claim the protection of\n",
      "the monks; and the people were interested in the glory of their virgin\n",
      "patroness. The sermons of the archbishop, and the service of the altar,\n",
      "were disturbed by seditious clamor; his authority and doctrine were\n",
      "renounced by separate congregations; every wind scattered round the\n",
      "empire the leaves of controversy; and the voice of the combatants on a\n",
      "sonorous theatre reÎchoed in the cells of Palestine and Egypt. It was\n",
      "the duty of Cyril to enlighten the zeal and ignorance of his innumerable\n",
      "monks: in the school of Alexandria, he had imbibed and professed the\n",
      "incarnation of one nature; and the successor of Athanasius consulted\n",
      "his pride and ambition, when he rose in arms against another Arius, more\n",
      "formidable and more guilty, on the second throne of the hierarchy. After\n",
      "a short correspondence, in which the rival prelates disguised their\n",
      "hatred in the hollow language of respect and charity, the patriarch of\n",
      "Alexandria denounced to the prince and people, to the East and to the\n",
      "West, the damnable errors of the Byzantine pontiff. From the East,\n",
      "more especially from Antioch, he obtained the ambiguous counsels of\n",
      "toleration and silence, which were addressed to both parties while they\n",
      "favored the cause of Nestorius. But the Vatican received with open arms\n",
      "the messengers of Egypt. The vanity of Celestine was flattered by the\n",
      "appeal; and the partial version of a monk decided the faith of the pope,\n",
      "who with his Latin clergy was ignorant of the language, the arts, and\n",
      "the theology of the Greeks. At the head of an Italian synod, Celestine\n",
      "weighed the merits of the cause, approved the creed of Cyril, condemned\n",
      "the sentiments and person of Nestorius, degraded the heretic from his\n",
      "episcopal dignity, allowed a respite of ten days for recantation and\n",
      "penance, and delegated to his enemy the execution of this rash and\n",
      "illegal sentence. But the patriarch of Alexandria, while he darted the\n",
      "thunders of a god, exposed the errors and passions of a mortal; and his\n",
      "twelve anathemas still torture the orthodox slaves, who adore the\n",
      "memory of a saint, without forfeiting their allegiance to the synod of\n",
      "Chalcedon. These bold assertions are indelibly tinged with the colors\n",
      "of the Apollinarian heresy; but the serious, and perhaps the sincere\n",
      "professions of Nestorius have satisfied the wiser and less partial\n",
      "theologians of the present times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet neither the emperor nor the primate of the East were disposed to\n",
      "obey the mandate of an Italian priest; and a synod of the Catholic, or\n",
      "rather of the Greek church, was unanimously demanded as the sole remedy\n",
      "that could appease or decide this ecclesiastical quarrel. Ephesus, on\n",
      "all sides accessible by sea and land, was chosen for the place, the\n",
      "festival of Pentecost for the day, of the meeting; a writ of summons was\n",
      "despatched to each metropolitan, and a guard was stationed to protect\n",
      "and confine the fathers till they should settle the mysteries of heaven,\n",
      "and the faith of the earth. Nestorius appeared not as a criminal, but\n",
      "as a judge; be depended on the weight rather than the number of his\n",
      "prelates, and his sturdy slaves from the baths of Zeuxippus were armed\n",
      "for every service of injury or defence. But his adversary Cyril was more\n",
      "powerful in the weapons both of the flesh and of the spirit. Disobedient\n",
      "to the letter, or at least to the meaning, of the royal summons, he was\n",
      "attended by fifty Egyptian bishops, who expected from their patriarch's\n",
      "nod the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. He had contracted an intimate\n",
      "alliance with Memnon, bishop of Ephesus. The despotic primate of Asia\n",
      "disposed of the ready succors of thirty or forty episcopal votes: a\n",
      "crowd of peasants, the slaves of the church, was poured into the city to\n",
      "support with blows and clamors a metaphysical argument; and the people\n",
      "zealously asserted the honor of the Virgin, whose body reposed within\n",
      "the walls of Ephesus. The fleet which had transported Cyril from\n",
      "Alexandria was laden with the riches of Egypt; and he disembarked a\n",
      "numerous body of mariners, slaves, and fanatics, enlisted with blind\n",
      "obedience under the banner of St. Mark and the mother of God. The\n",
      "fathers, and even the guards, of the council were awed by this martial\n",
      "array; the adversaries of Cyril and Mary were insulted in the streets,\n",
      "or threatened in their houses; his eloquence and liberality made a daily\n",
      "increase in the number of his adherents; and the Egyptian soon computed\n",
      "that he might command the attendance and the voices of two hundred\n",
      "bishops. But the author of the twelve anathemas foresaw and dreaded the\n",
      "opposition of John of Antioch, who, with a small, but respectable, train\n",
      "of metropolitans and divines, was advancing by slow journeys from the\n",
      "distant capital of the East. Impatient of a delay, which he stigmatized\n",
      "as voluntary and culpable, Cyril announced the opening of the synod\n",
      "sixteen days after the festival of Pentecost. Nestorius, who depended\n",
      "on the near approach of his Eastern friends, persisted, like his\n",
      "predecessor Chrysostom, to disclaim the jurisdiction, and to disobey\n",
      "the summons, of his enemies: they hastened his trial, and his accuser\n",
      "presided in the seat of judgment. Sixty-eight bishops, twenty-two of\n",
      "metropolitan rank, defended his cause by a modest and temperate protest:\n",
      "they were excluded from the councils of their brethren. Candidian,\n",
      "in the emperor's name, requested a delay of four days; the profane\n",
      "magistrate was driven with outrage and insult from the assembly of the\n",
      "saints. The whole of this momentous transaction was crowded into\n",
      "the compass of a summer's day: the bishops delivered their separate\n",
      "opinions; but the uniformity of style reveals the influence or the hand\n",
      "of a master, who has been accused of corrupting the public evidence\n",
      "of their acts and subscriptions. Without a dissenting voice, they\n",
      "recognized in the epistles of Cyril the Nicene creed and the doctrine of\n",
      "the fathers: but the partial extracts from the letters and homilies of\n",
      "Nestorius were interrupted by curses and anathemas: and the heretic was\n",
      "degraded from his episcopal and ecclesiastical dignity. The sentence,\n",
      "maliciously inscribed to the new Judas, was affixed and proclaimed in\n",
      "the streets of Ephesus: the weary prelates, as they issued from the\n",
      "church of the mother of God, were saluted as her champions; and her\n",
      "victory was celebrated by the illuminations, the songs, and the tumult\n",
      "of the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the fifth day, the triumph was clouded by the arrival and indignation\n",
      "of the Eastern bishops. In a chamber of the inn, before he had wiped\n",
      "the dust from his shoes, John of Antioch gave audience to Candidian, the\n",
      "Imperial minister; who related his ineffectual efforts to prevent or to\n",
      "annul the hasty violence of the Egyptian. With equal haste and violence,\n",
      "the Oriental synod of fifty bishops degraded Cyril and Memnon from their\n",
      "episcopal honors, condemned, in the twelve anathemas, the purest venom\n",
      "of the Apollinarian heresy, and described the Alexandrian primate as a\n",
      "monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church. His throne\n",
      "was distant and inaccessible; but they instantly resolved to bestow\n",
      "on the flock of Ephesus the blessing of a faithful shepherd. By the\n",
      "vigilance of Memnon, the churches were shut against them, and a strong\n",
      "garrison was thrown into the cathedral. The troops, under the command of\n",
      "Candidian, advanced to the assault; the outguards were routed and put to\n",
      "the sword, but the place was impregnable: the besiegers retired; their\n",
      "retreat was pursued by a vigorous sally; they lost their horses, and\n",
      "many of their soldiers were dangerously wounded with clubs and stones.\n",
      "Ephesus, the city of the Virgin, was defiled with rage and clamor,\n",
      "with sedition and blood; the rival synods darted anathemas and\n",
      "excommunications from their spiritual engines; and the court of\n",
      "Theodosius was perplexed by the adverse and contradictory narratives of\n",
      "the Syrian and Egyptian factions. During a busy period of three months,\n",
      "the emperor tried every method, except the most effectual means of\n",
      "indifference and contempt, to reconcile this theological quarrel. He\n",
      "attempted to remove or intimidate the leaders by a common sentence, of\n",
      "acquittal or condemnation; he invested his representatives at Ephesus\n",
      "with ample power and military force; he summoned from either party eight\n",
      "chosen deputies to a free and candid conference in the neighborhood of\n",
      "the capital, far from the contagion of popular frenzy. But the Orientals\n",
      "refused to yield, and the Catholics, proud of their numbers and of their\n",
      "Latin allies, rejected all terms of union or toleration. The patience\n",
      "of the meek Theodosius was provoked; and he dissolved in anger this\n",
      "episcopal tumult, which at the distance of thirteen centuries assumes\n",
      "the venerable aspect of the third cumenical council. \"God is my\n",
      "witness,\" said the pious prince, \"that I am not the author of this\n",
      "confusion. His providence will discern and punish the guilty. Return\n",
      "to your provinces, and may your private virtues repair the mischief and\n",
      "scandal of your meeting.\" They returned to their provinces; but the same\n",
      "passions which had distracted the synod of Ephesus were diffused over\n",
      "the Eastern world. After three obstinate and equal campaigns, John of\n",
      "Antioch and Cyril of Alexandria condescended to explain and embrace: but\n",
      "their seeming reunion must be imputed rather to prudence than to reason,\n",
      "to the mutual lassitude rather than to the Christian charity of the\n",
      "patriarchs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Byzantine pontiff had instilled into the royal ear a baleful\n",
      "prejudice against the character and conduct of his Egyptian rival. An\n",
      "epistle of menace and invective, which accompanied the summons,\n",
      "accused him as a busy, insolent, and envious priest, who perplexed the\n",
      "simplicity of the faith, violated the peace of the church and state,\n",
      "and, by his artful and separate addresses to the wife and sister of\n",
      "Theodosius, presumed to suppose, or to scatter, the seeds of discord in\n",
      "the Imperial family. At the stern command of his sovereign. Cyril had\n",
      "repaired to Ephesus, where he was resisted, threatened, and confined,\n",
      "by the magistrates in the interest of Nestorius and the Orientals; who\n",
      "assembled the troops of Lydia and Ionia to suppress the fanatic and\n",
      "disorderly train of the patriarch. Without expecting the royal license,\n",
      "he escaped from his guards, precipitately embarked, deserted the\n",
      "imperfect synod, and retired to his episcopal fortress of safety and\n",
      "independence. But his artful emissaries, both in the court and city,\n",
      "successfully labored to appease the resentment, and to conciliate the\n",
      "favor, of the emperor. The feeble son of Arcadius was alternately\n",
      "swayed by his wife and sister, by the eunuchs and women of the palace:\n",
      "superstition and avarice were their ruling passions; and the orthodox\n",
      "chiefs were assiduous in their endeavors to alarm the former, and to\n",
      "gratify the latter. Constantinople and the suburbs were sanctified with\n",
      "frequent monasteries, and the holy abbots, Dalmatius and Eutyches, had\n",
      "devoted their zeal and fidelity to the cause of Cyril, the worship of\n",
      "Mary, and the unity of Christ. From the first moment of their monastic\n",
      "life, they had never mingled with the world, or trod the profane ground\n",
      "of the city. But in this awful moment of the danger of the church, their\n",
      "vow was superseded by a more sublime and indispensable duty. At the\n",
      "head of a long order of monks and hermits, who carried burning tapers in\n",
      "their hands, and chanted litanies to the mother of God, they proceeded\n",
      "from their monasteries to the palace. The people was edified and\n",
      "inflamed by this extraordinary spectacle, and the trembling monarch\n",
      "listened to the prayers and adjurations of the saints, who boldly\n",
      "pronounced, that none could hope for salvation, unless they embraced\n",
      "the person and the creed of the orthodox successor of Athanasius. At the\n",
      "same time, every avenue of the throne was assaulted with gold. Under\n",
      "the decent names of _eulogies_ and _benedictions_, the courtiers of\n",
      "both sexes were bribed according to the measure of their power and\n",
      "rapaciousness. But their incessant demands despoiled the sanctuaries of\n",
      "Constantinople and Alexandria; and the authority of the patriarch was\n",
      "unable to silence the just murmur of his clergy, that a debt of sixty\n",
      "thousand pounds had already been contracted to support the expense of\n",
      "this scandalous corruption. Pulcheria, who relieved her brother from\n",
      "the weight of an empire, was the firmest pillar of orthodoxy; and so\n",
      "intimate was the alliance between the thunders of the synod and the\n",
      "whispers of the court, that Cyril was assured of success if he could\n",
      "displace one eunuch, and substitute another in the favor of Theodosius.\n",
      "Yet the Egyptian could not boast of a glorious or decisive victory.\n",
      "The emperor, with unaccustomed firmness, adhered to his promise of\n",
      "protecting the innocence of the Oriental bishops; and Cyril softened\n",
      "his anathemas, and confessed, with ambiguity and reluctance, a twofold\n",
      "nature of Christ, before he was permitted to satiate his revenge against\n",
      "the unfortunate Nestorius.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rash and obstinate Nestorius, before the end of the synod, was\n",
      "oppressed by Cyril, betrayed by the court, and faintly supported by his\n",
      "Eastern friends. A sentiment or fear or indignation prompted him, while\n",
      "it was yet time, to affect the glory of a voluntary abdication: his\n",
      "wish, or at least his request, was readily granted; he was conducted\n",
      "with honor from Ephesus to his old monastery of Antioch; and, after a\n",
      "short pause, his successors, Maximian and Proclus, were acknowledged as\n",
      "the lawful bishops of Constantinople. But in the silence of his cell,\n",
      "the degraded patriarch could no longer resume the innocence and security\n",
      "of a private monk. The past he regretted, he was discontented with the\n",
      "present, and the future he had reason to dread: the Oriental bishops\n",
      "successively disengaged their cause from his unpopular name, and each\n",
      "day decreased the number of the schismatics who revered Nestorius as the\n",
      "confessor of the faith. After a residence at Antioch of four years, the\n",
      "hand of Theodosius subscribed an edict, which ranked him with Simon the\n",
      "magician, proscribed his opinions and followers, condemned his writings\n",
      "to the flames, and banished his person first to Petra, in Arabia, and at\n",
      "length to Oasis, one of the islands of the Libyan desert. Secluded from\n",
      "the church and from the world, the exile was still pursued by the rage\n",
      "of bigotry and war. A wandering tribe of the Blemmyes or Nubians invaded\n",
      "his solitary prison: in their retreat they dismissed a crowd of useless\n",
      "captives: but no sooner had Nestorius reached the banks of the Nile,\n",
      "than he would gladly have escaped from a Roman and orthodox city, to the\n",
      "milder servitude of the savages. His flight was punished as a new crime:\n",
      "the soul of the patriarch inspired the civil and ecclesiastical powers\n",
      "of Egypt; the magistrates, the soldiers, the monks, devoutly tortured\n",
      "the enemy of Christ and St. Cyril; and, as far as the confines of\n",
      "∆thiopia, the heretic was alternately dragged and recalled, till his\n",
      "aged body was broken by the hardships and accidents of these reiterated\n",
      "journeys. Yet his mind was still independent and erect; the president\n",
      "of Thebais was awed by his pastoral letters; he survived the Catholic\n",
      "tyrant of Alexandria, and, after sixteen years' banishment, the synod of\n",
      "Chalcedon would perhaps have restored him to the honors, or at least\n",
      "to the communion, of the church. The death of Nestorius prevented his\n",
      "obedience to their welcome summons; and his disease might afford some\n",
      "color to the scandalous report, that his tongue, the organ of blasphemy,\n",
      "had been eaten by the worms. He was buried in a city of Upper Egypt,\n",
      "known by the names of Chemnis, or Panopolis, or Akmim; but the immortal\n",
      "malice of the Jacobites has persevered for ages to cast stones against\n",
      "his sepulchre, and to propagate the foolish tradition, that it was never\n",
      "watered by the rain of heaven, which equally descends on the righteous\n",
      "and the ungodly. Humanity may drop a tear on the fate of Nestorius;\n",

      "ten metropolitans and ten bishops from each of the six dioceses of the\n",
      "Eastern empire: some exceptions of favor or merit enlarged the number to\n",
      "one hundred and thirty-five; and the Syrian Barsumas, as the chief\n",

      "patriarch again oppressed the freedom of debate: the same spiritual and\n",
      "carnal weapons were again drawn from the arsenals of Egypt: the Asiatic\n",
      "veterans, a band of archers, served under the orders of Dioscorus; and\n",
      "the more formidable monks, whose minds were inaccessible to reason or\n",
      "mercy, besieged the doors of the cathedral. The general, and, as it\n",
      "should seem, the unconstrained voice of the fathers, accepted the faith\n",

      "with the zeal of martyrdom, they successively subscribed a blank paper,\n",
      "which was afterwards filled with the condemnation of the Byzantine\n",

      "project of a Latin council: he disdained to preside in the Greek synod,\n",
      "which was speedily assembled at Nice in Bithynia; his legates required\n",
      "in a peremptory tone the presence of the emperor; and the weary fathers\n",
      "were transported to Chalcedon under the immediate eye of Marcian and\n",
      "the senate of Constantinople. A quarter of a mile from the Thracian\n",
      "Bosphorus, the church of St. Euphemia was built on the summit of a\n",
      "gentle though lofty ascent: the triple structure was celebrated as a\n",
      "prodigy of art, and the boundless prospect of the land and sea might\n",
      "have raised the mind of a sectary to the contemplation of the God of\n",
      "the universe. Six hundred and thirty bishops were ranged in order in the\n",
      "nave of the church; but the patriarchs of the East were preceded by the\n",
      "legates, of whom the third was a simple priest; and the place of honor\n",
      "was reserved for twenty laymen of consular or senatorian rank. The\n",
      "gospel was ostentatiously displayed in the centre, but the rule of\n",
      "faith was defined by the Papal and Imperial ministers, who moderated\n",
      "the thirteen sessions of the council of Chalcedon. Their partial\n",
      "interposition silenced the intemperate shouts and execrations, which\n",
      "degraded the episcopal gravity; but, on the formal accusation of the\n",
      "legates, Dioscorus was compelled to descend from his throne to the\n",
      "rank of a criminal, already condemned in the opinion of his judges. The\n",
      "Orientals, less adverse to Nestorius than to Cyril, accepted the Romans\n",
      "as their deliverers: Thrace, and Pontus, and Asia, were exasperated\n",
      "against the murderer of Flavian, and the new patriarchs of\n",
      "Constantinople and Antioch secured their places by the sacrifice of\n",
      "their benefactor. The bishops of Palestine, Macedonia, and Greece, were\n",
      "attached to the faith of Cyril; but in the face of the synod, in the\n",
      "heat of the battle, the leaders, with their obsequious train, passed\n",
      "from the right to the left wing, and decided the victory by this\n",
      "seasonable desertion. Of the seventeen suffragans who sailed from\n",
      "Alexandria, four were tempted from their allegiance, and the thirteen,\n",
      "falling prostrate on the ground, implored the mercy of the council, with\n",
      "sighs and tears, and a pathetic declaration, that, if they yielded, they\n",
      "should be massacred, on their return to Egypt, by the indignant people.\n",
      "A tardy repentance was allowed to expiate the guilt or error of the\n",
      "accomplices of Dioscorus: but their sins were accumulated on his head;\n",
      "he neither asked nor hoped for pardon, and the moderation of those\n",
      "who pleaded for a general amnesty was drowned in the prevailing cry of\n",
      "victory and revenge. To save the reputation of his late adherents,\n",
      "some _personal_ offences were skilfully detected; his rash and illegal\n",
      "excommunication of the pope, and his contumacious refusal (while he was\n",
      "detained a prisoner) to attend to the summons of the synod. Witnesses\n",
      "were introduced to prove the special facts of his pride, avarice, and\n",
      "cruelty; and the fathers heard with abhorrence, that the alms of the\n",
      "church were lavished on the female dancers, that his palace, and even\n",
      "his bath, was open to the prostitutes of Alexandria, and that the\n",
      "infamous Pansophia, or Irene, was publicly entertained as the concubine\n",
      "of the patriarch.\n",
      "\n",
      "For these scandalous offences, Dioscorus was deposed by the synod, and\n",
      "banished by the emperor; but the purity of his faith was declared in the\n",
      "presence, and with the tacit approbation, of the fathers. Their prudence\n",
      "supposed rather than pronounced the heresy of Eutyches, who was never\n",
      "summoned before their tribunal; and they sat silent and abashed, when\n",
      "a bold Monophysite casting at their feet a volume of Cyril, challenged\n",
      "them to anathematize in his person the doctrine of the saint. If we\n",
      "fairly peruse the acts of Chalcedon as they are recorded by the orthodox\n",
      "party, we shall find that a great majority of the bishops embraced the\n",
      "simple unity of Christ; and the ambiguous concession that he was formed\n",
      "Of or From two natures, might imply either their previous existence,\n",
      "or their subsequent confusion, or some dangerous interval between the\n",
      "conception of the man and the assumption of the God. The Roman theology,\n",
      "more positive and precise, adopted the term most offensive to the ears\n",
      "of the Egyptians, that Christ existed In two natures; and this momentous\n",
      "particle (which the memory, rather than the understanding, must retain)\n",
      "had almost produced a schism among the Catholic bishops. The _tome_\n",
      "of Leo had been respectfully, perhaps sincerely, subscribed; but they\n",
      "protested, in two successive debates, that it was neither expedient nor\n",
      "lawful to transgress the sacred landmarks which had been fixed at Nice,\n",
      "Constantinople, and Ephesus, according to the rule of Scripture and\n",
      "tradition. At length they yielded to the importunities of their masters;\n",
      "but their infallible decree, after it had been ratified with deliberate\n",
      "votes and vehement acclamations, was overturned in the next session by\n",
      "the opposition of the legates and their Oriental friends. It was in vain\n",
      "that a multitude of episcopal voices repeated in chorus, \"The definition\n",
      "of the fathers is orthodox and immutable! The heretics are now\n",
      "discovered! Anathema to the Nestorians! Let them depart from the synod!\n",
      "Let them repair to Rome.\" The legates threatened, the emperor was\n",
      "absolute, and a committee of eighteen bishops prepared a new decree,\n",
      "which was imposed on the reluctant assembly. In the name of the fourth\n",
      "general council, the Christ in one person, but in two natures, was\n",
      "announced to the Catholic world: an invisible line was drawn between\n",
      "the heresy of Apollinaris and the faith of St. Cyril; and the road to\n",
      "paradise, a bridge as sharp as a razor, was suspended over the abyss\n",
      "by the master-hand of the theological artist. During ten centuries of\n",
      "blindness and servitude, Europe received her religious opinions from the\n",
      "oracle of the Vatican; and the same doctrine, already varnished with the\n",
      "rust of antiquity, was admitted without dispute into the creed of the\n",
      "reformers, who disclaimed the supremacy of the Roman pontiff. The synod\n",
      "of Chalcedon still triumphs in the Protestant churches; but the ferment\n",
      "of controversy has subsided, and the most pious Christians of the\n",
      "present day are ignorant, or careless, of their own belief concerning\n",
      "the mystery of the incarnation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Far different was the temper of the Greeks and Egyptians under the\n",
      "orthodox reigns of Leo and Marcian. Those pious emperors enforced with\n",
      "arms and edicts the symbol of their faith; and it was declared by the\n",
      "conscience or honor of five hundred bishops, that the decrees of the\n",
      "synod of Chalcedon might be lawfully supported, even with blood. The\n",
      "Catholics observed with satisfaction, that the same synod was odious\n",
      "both to the Nestorians and the Monophysites; but the Nestorians were\n",
      "less angry, or less powerful, and the East was distracted by the\n",
      "obstinate and sanguinary zeal of the Monophysites. Jerusalem was\n",
      "occupied by an army of monks; in the name of the one incarnate nature,\n",
      "they pillaged, they burnt, they murdered; the sepulchre of Christ was\n",
      "defiled with blood; and the gates of the city were guarded in tumultuous\n",
      "rebellion against the troops of the emperor. After the disgrace and\n",
      "exile of Dioscorus, the Egyptians still regretted their spiritual\n",
      "father; and detested the usurpation of his successor, who was introduced\n",
      "by the fathers of Chalcedon. The throne of Proterius was supported by a\n",
      "guard of two thousand soldiers: he waged a five years' war against the\n",
      "people of Alexandria; and on the first intelligence of the death of\n",
      "Marcian, he became the victim of their zeal. On the third day before\n",
      "the festival of Easter, the patriarch was besieged in the cathedral,\n",
      "and murdered in the baptistery. The remains of his mangled corpse were\n",
      "delivered to the flames, and his ashes to the wind; and the deed was\n",
      "inspired by the vision of a pretended angel: an ambitious monk, who,\n",
      "under the name of Timothy the Cat, succeeded to the place and opinions\n",
      "of Dioscorus. This deadly superstition was inflamed, on either side,\n",
      "by the principle and the practice of retaliation: in the pursuit of a\n",
      "metaphysical quarrel, many thousands were slain, and the Christians of\n",
      "every degree were deprived of the substantial enjoyments of social life,\n",
      "and of the invisible gifts of baptism and the holy communion. Perhaps\n",
      "an extravagant fable of the times may conceal an allegorical picture\n",
      "of these fanatics, who tortured each other and themselves. \"Under the\n",
      "consulship of Venantius and Celer,\" says a grave bishop, \"the people\n",
      "of Alexandria, and all Egypt, were seized with a strange and diabolical\n",
      "frenzy: great and small, slaves and freedmen, monks and clergy, the\n",
      "natives of the land, who opposed the synod of Chalcedon, lost their\n",
      "speech and reason, barked like dogs, and tore, with their own teeth the\n",

      "The disorders of thirty years at length produced the famous Henoticon\n",
      "of the emperor Zeno, which in his reign, and in that of Anastasius, was\n",
      "signed by all the bishops of the East, under the penalty of degradation\n",
      "and exile, if they rejected or infringed this salutary and fundamental\n",
      "law. The clergy may smile or groan at the presumption of a layman who\n",
      "defines the articles of faith; yet if he stoops to the humiliating task,\n",
      "his mind is less infected by prejudice or interest, and the authority of\n",
      "the magistrate can only be maintained by the concord of the people. It\n",
      "is in ecclesiastical story, that Zeno appears least contemptible; and I\n",
      "am not able to discern any ManichÊan or Eutychian guilt in the generous\n",
      "saying of Anastasius. That it was unworthy of an emperor to persecute\n",
      "the worshippers of Christ and the citizens of Rome. The Henoticon was\n",
      "most pleasing to the Egyptians; yet the smallest blemish has not been\n",
      "described by the jealous, and even jaundiced eyes of our orthodox\n",
      "schoolmen, and it accurately represents the Catholic faith of the\n",
      "incarnation, without adopting or disclaiming the peculiar terms of\n",
      "tenets of the hostile sects. A solemn anathema is pronounced against\n",
      "Nestorius and Eutyches; against all heretics by whom Christ is divided,\n",
      "or confounded, or reduced to a phantom. Without defining the number\n",
      "or the article of the word _nature_, the pure system of St. Cyril, the\n",
      "faith of Nice, Constantinople, and Ephesus, is respectfully confirmed;\n",
      "but, instead of bowing at the name of the fourth council, the subject\n",
      "is dismissed by the censure of all contrary doctrines, _if_ any such\n",
      "have been taught either elsewhere or at Chalcedon. Under this ambiguous\n",
      "expression, the friends and the enemies of the last synod might unite in\n",
      "a silent embrace. The most reasonable Christians acquiesced in this mode\n",
      "of toleration; but their reason was feeble and inconstant, and their\n",
      "obedience was despised as timid and servile by the vehement spirit of\n",
      "their brethren. On a subject which engrossed the thoughts and discourses\n",
      "of men, it was difficult to preserve an exact neutrality; a book, a\n",
      "sermon, a prayer, rekindled the flame of controversy; and the bonds of\n",
      "communion were alternately broken and renewed by the private animosity\n",
      "of the bishops. The space between Nestorius and Eutyches was filled by\n",
      "a thousand shades of language and opinion; the _acephali_ of Egypt, and\n",
      "the Roman pontiffs, of equal valor, though of unequal strength, may be\n",
      "found at the two extremities of the theological scale. The acephali,\n",
      "without a king or a bishop, were separated above three hundred years\n",
      "from the patriarchs of Alexandria, who had accepted the communion of\n",
      "Constantinople, without exacting a formal condemnation of the synod of\n",
      "Chalcedon. For accepting the communion of Alexandria, without a formal\n",
      "approbation of the same synod, the patriarchs of Constantinople were\n",
      "anathematized by the popes. Their inflexible despotism involved the most\n",
      "orthodox of the Greek churches in this spiritual contagion, denied or\n",
      "doubted the validity of their sacraments, and fomented, thirty-five\n",
      "years, the schism of the East and West, till they finally abolished the\n",
      "memory of four Byzantine pontiffs, who had dared to oppose the supremacy\n",
      "of St. Peter. Before that period, the precarious truce of Constantinople\n",
      "and Egypt had been violated by the zeal of the rival prelates.\n",
      "Macedonius, who was suspected of the Nestorian heresy, asserted, in\n",
      "disgrace and exile, the synod of Chalcedon, while the successor of Cyril\n",
      "would have purchased its overthrow with a bribe of two thousand pounds\n",
      "of gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fever of the times, the sense, or rather the sound of a syllable,\n",
      "was sufficient to disturb the peace of an empire. The Trisagion (thrice\n",
      "holy,) \"Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts!\" is supposed, by the\n",
      "Greeks, to be the identical hymn which the angels and cherubim eternally\n",
      "repeat before the throne of God, and which, about the middle of\n",
      "the fifth century, was miraculously revealed to the church of\n",
      "Constantinople. The devotion of Antioch soon added, \"who was crucified\n",
      "for us!\" and this grateful address, either to Christ alone, or to the\n",
      "whole Trinity, may be justified by the rules of theology, and has been\n",
      "gradually adopted by the Catholics of the East and West. But it had\n",
      "been imagined by a Monophysite bishop; the gift of an enemy was at first\n",
      "rejected as a dire and dangerous blasphemy, and the rash innovation had\n",
      "nearly cost the emperor Anastasius his throne and his life. The people\n",
      "of Constantinople was devoid of any rational principles of freedom; but\n",
      "they held, as a lawful cause of rebellion, the color of a livery in the\n",
      "races, or the color of a mystery in the schools. The Trisagion, with\n",
      "and without this obnoxious addition, was chanted in the cathedral by two\n",
      "adverse choirs, and when their lungs were exhausted, they had recourse\n",
      "to the more solid arguments of sticks and stones; the aggressors were\n",
      "punished by the emperor, and defended by the patriarch; and the crown\n",
      "and mitre were staked on the event of this momentous quarrel. The\n",
      "streets were instantly crowded with innumerable swarms of men, women,\n",
      "and children; the legions of monks, in regular array, marched, and\n",
      "shouted, and fought at their head, \"Christians! this is the day of\n",
      "martyrdom: let us not desert our spiritual father; anathema to the\n",
      "ManichÊan tyrant! he is unworthy to reign.\" Such was the Catholic cry;\n",
      "and the galleys of Anastasius lay upon their oars before the palace,\n",
      "till the patriarch had pardoned his penitent, and hushed the waves\n",
      "of the troubled multitude. The triumph of Macedonius was checked by a\n",
      "speedy exile; but the zeal of his flock was again exasperated by the\n",
      "same question, \"Whether one of the Trinity had been crucified?\" On\n",
      "this momentous occasion, the blue and green factions of Constantinople\n",
      "suspended their discord, and the civil and military powers were\n",
      "annihilated in their presence. The keys of the city, and the standards\n",
      "of the guards, were deposited in the forum of Constantine, the principal\n",
      "station and camp of the faithful. Day and night they were incessantly\n",
      "busied either in singing hymns to the honor of their God, or in\n",
      "pillaging and murdering the servants of their prince. The head of his\n",
      "favorite monk, the friend, as they styled him, of the enemy of the Holy\n",
      "Trinity, was borne aloft on a spear; and the firebrands, which had\n",
      "been darted against heretical structures, diffused the undistinguishing\n",
      "flames over the most orthodox buildings. The statues of the emperor were\n",
      "broken, and his person was concealed in a suburb, till, at the end of\n",
      "three days, he dared to implore the mercy of his subjects. Without his\n",
      "diadem, and in the posture of a suppliant, Anastasius appeared on the\n",
      "throne of the circus. The Catholics, before his face, rehearsed their\n",
      "genuine Trisagion; they exulted in the offer, which he proclaimed by\n",
      "the voice of a herald, of abdicating the purple; they listened to the\n",
      "admonition, that, since _all_ could not reign, they should previously\n",
      "agree in the choice of a sovereign; and they accepted the blood of two\n",
      "unpopular ministers, whom their master, without hesitation, condemned to\n",
      "the lions. These furious but transient seditions were encouraged by the\n",
      "success of Vitalian, who, with an army of Huns and Bulgarians, for\n",
      "the most part idolaters, declared himself the champion of the Catholic\n",
      "faith. In this pious rebellion he depopulated Thrace, besieged\n",
      "Constantinople, exterminated sixty-five thousand of his\n",
      "fellow-Christians, till he obtained the recall of the bishops, the\n",
      "satisfaction of the pope, and the establishment of the council\n",
      "of Chalcedon, an orthodox treaty, reluctantly signed by the dying\n",
      "Anastasius, and more faithfully performed by the uncle of Justinian. And\n",

      "Justinian has been already seen in the various lights of a prince, a\n",
      "conqueror, and a lawgiver: the theologian still remains, and it affords\n",
      "an unfavorable prejudice, that his theology should form a very prominent\n",
      "feature of his portrait. The sovereign sympathized with his subjects in\n",
      "their superstitious reverence for living and departed saints: his Code,\n",
      "and more especially his Novels, confirm and enlarge the privileges\n",
      "of the clergy; and in every dispute between a monk and a layman, the\n",
      "partial judge was inclined to pronounce, that truth, and innocence,\n",
      "and justice, were always on the side of the church. In his public and\n",
      "private devotions, the emperor was assiduous and exemplary; his prayers,\n",
      "vigils, and fasts, displayed the austere penance of a monk; his fancy\n",
      "was amused by the hope, or belief, of personal inspiration; he had\n",
      "secured the patronage of the Virgin and St. Michael the archangel; and\n",
      "his recovery from a dangerous disease was ascribed to the miraculous\n",
      "succor of the holy martyrs Cosmas and Damian. The capital and the\n",
      "provinces of the East were decorated with the monuments of his religion;\n",
      "and though the far greater part of these costly structures may be\n",
      "attributed to his taste or ostentation, the zeal of the royal architect\n",
      "was probably quickened by a genuine sense of love and gratitude towards\n",
      "his invisible benefactors. Among the titles of Imperial greatness, the\n",
      "name of _Pious_ was most pleasing to his ear; to promote the temporal\n",
      "and spiritual interest of the church was the serious business of his\n",
      "life; and the duty of father of his country was often sacrificed to that\n",
      "of defender of the faith. The controversies of the times were congenial\n",
      "to his temper and understanding and the theological professors must\n",
      "inwardly deride the diligence of a stranger, who cultivated their art\n",
      "and neglected his own. \"What can ye fear,\" said a bold conspirator to\n",
      "his associates, \"from your bigoted tyrant? Sleepless and unarmed, he\n",
      "sits whole nights in his closet, debating with reverend graybeards, and\n",
      "turning over the pages of ecclesiastical volumes.\" The fruits of these\n",
      "lucubrations were displayed in many a conference, where Justinian might\n",
      "shine as the loudest and most subtile of the disputants; in many a\n",
      "sermon, which, under the name of edicts and epistles, proclaimed to the\n",
      "empire the theology of their master. While the Barbarians invaded the\n",
      "provinces, while the victorious legion marched under the banners of\n",
      "Belisarius and Narses, the successor of Trajan, unknown to the camp,\n",
      "was content to vanquish at the head of a synod. Had he invited to these\n",

      "learned, \"_that_ religious controversy is the offspring of arrogance\n",
      "and folly; _that_ true piety is most laudably expressed by silence and\n",
      "submission; _that_ man, ignorant of his own nature, should not presume\n",

      "narrow and peevish character of a disputant, he is easily provoked to\n",
      "supply the defect of argument by the plenitude of power, and to chastise\n",
      "without mercy the perverse blindness of those who wilfully shut their\n",
      "eyes against the light of demonstration. The reign of Justinian was\n",
      "a uniform yet various scene of persecution; and he appears to have\n",
      "surpassed his indolent predecessors, both in the contrivance of his laws\n",
      "and the rigor of their execution. The insufficient term of three months\n",
      "was assigned for the conversion or exile of all heretics; and if he\n",

      "his iron yoke, not only of the benefits of society, but of the common\n",

      "the provinces, and the trophies of the Barbarians. A secret remnant of\n",
      "Pagans, who still lurked in the most refined and most rustic conditions\n",
      "of mankind, excited the indignation of the Christians, who were perhaps\n",
      "unwilling that any strangers should be the witnesses of their intestine\n",
      "quarrels. A bishop was named as the inquisitor of the faith, and his\n",
      "diligence soon discovered, in the court and city, the magistrates,\n",
      "lawyers, physicians, and sophists, who still cherished the superstition\n",
      "of the Greeks. They were sternly informed that they must choose without\n",
      "delay between the displeasure of Jupiter or Justinian, and that their\n",
      "aversion to the gospel could no longer be distinguished under the\n",
      "scandalous mask of indifference or impiety. The patrician Photius,\n",
      "perhaps, alone was resolved to live and to die like his ancestors: he\n",
      "enfranchised himself with the stroke of a dagger, and left his tyrant\n",
      "the poor consolation of exposing with ignominy the lifeless corpse of\n",
      "the fugitive. His weaker brethren submitted to their earthly monarch,\n",
      "underwent the ceremony of baptism, and labored, by their extraordinary\n",
      "zeal, to erase the suspicion, or to expiate the guilt, of idolatry.\n",
      "The native country of Homer, and the theatre of the Trojan war, still\n",
      "retained the last sparks of his mythology: by the care of the same\n",
      "bishop, seventy thousand Pagans were detected and converted in Asia,\n",
      "Phrygia, Lydia, and Caria; ninety-six churches were built for the new\n",
      "proselytes; and linen vestments, Bibles, and liturgies, and vases of\n",
      "gold and silver, were supplied by the pious munificence of Justinian.\n",
      "The Jews, who had been gradually stripped of their immunities, were\n",
      "oppressed by a vexatious law, which compelled them to observe the\n",
      "festival of Easter the same day on which it was celebrated by the\n",
      "Christians. And they might complain with the more reason, since the\n",
      "Catholics themselves did not agree with the astronomical calculations of\n",
      "their sovereign: the people of Constantinople delayed the beginning of\n",
      "their Lent a whole week after it had been ordained by authority; and\n",
      "they had the pleasure of fasting seven days, while meat was exposed for\n",
      "sale by the command of the emperor. The Samaritans of Palestine were a\n",
      "motley race, an ambiguous sect, rejected as Jews by the Pagans, by the\n",
      "Jews as schismatics, and by the Christians as idolaters. The abomination\n",
      "of the cross had already been planted on their holy mount of Garizim,\n",
      "but the persecution of Justinian offered only the alternative of baptism\n",
      "or rebellion. They chose the latter: under the standard of a desperate\n",
      "leader, they rose in arms, and retaliated their wrongs on the lives, the\n",
      "property, and the temples, of a defenceless people. The Samaritans were\n",
      "finally subdued by the regular forces of the East: twenty thousand were\n",
      "slain, twenty thousand were sold by the Arabs to the infidels of Persia\n",
      "and India, and the remains of that unhappy nation atoned for the crime\n",
      "of treason by the sin of hypocrisy. It has been computed that one\n",
      "hundred thousand Roman subjects were extirpated in the Samaritan war,\n",
      "which converted the once fruitful province into a desolate and smoking\n",
      "wilderness. But in the creed of Justinian, the guilt of murder could not\n",
      "be applied to the slaughter of unbelievers; and he piously labored to\n",
      "establish with fire and sword the unity of the Christian faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these sentiments, it was incumbent on him, at least, to be always\n",
      "in the right. In the first years of his administration, he signalized\n",
      "his zeal as the disciple and patron of orthodoxy: the reconciliation of\n",
      "the Greeks and Latins established the _tome_ of St. Leo as the creed of\n",
      "the emperor and the empire; the Nestorians and Eutychians were exposed.\n",
      "on either side, to the double edge of persecution; and the four synods\n",
      "of Nice, Constantinople, Ephesus, and _Chalcedon_, were ratified by the\n",
      "code of a Catholic lawgiver. But while Justinian strove to maintain the\n",
      "uniformity of faith and worship, his wife Theodora, whose vices were not\n",
      "incompatible with devotion, had listened to the Monophysite teachers;\n",
      "and the open or clandestine enemies of the church revived and multiplied\n",
      "at the smile of their gracious patroness. The capital, the palace, the\n",
      "nuptial bed, were torn by spiritual discord; yet so doubtful was the\n",
      "sincerity of the royal consorts, that their seeming disagreement was\n",
      "imputed by many to a secret and mischievous confederacy against the\n",
      "religion and happiness of their people. The famous dispute of the Three\n",
      "Chapters, which has filled more volumes than it deserves lines, is\n",
      "deeply marked with this subtile and disingenuous spirit. It was now\n",
      "three hundred years since the body of Origen had been eaten by the\n",
      "worms: his soul, of which he held the preexistence, was in the hands\n",
      "of its Creator; but his writings were eagerly perused by the monks of\n",
      "Palestine. In these writings, the piercing eye of Justinian descried\n",
      "more than ten metaphysical errors; and the primitive doctor, in the\n",
      "company of Pythagoras and Plato, was devoted by the clergy to the\n",
      "_eternity_ of hell-fire, which he had presumed to deny. Under the\n",
      "cover of this precedent, a treacherous blow was aimed at the council of\n",
      "Chalcedon. The fathers had listened without impatience to the praise\n",
      "of Theodore of Mopsuestia; and their justice or indulgence had restored\n",
      "both Theodore of Cyrrhus, and Ibas of Edessa, to the communion of the\n",
      "church. But the characters of these Oriental bishops were tainted with\n",
      "the reproach of heresy; the first had been the master, the two others\n",
      "were the friends, of Nestorius; their most suspicious passages were\n",
      "accused under the title of the _three chapters_; and the condemnation\n",
      "of their memory must involve the honor of a synod, whose name was\n",
      "pronounced with sincere or affected reverence by the Catholic world. If\n",
      "these bishops, whether innocent or guilty, were annihilated in the sleep\n",
      "of death, they would not probably be awakened by the clamor which, after\n",
      "the a hundred years, was raised over their grave. If they were already\n",
      "in the fangs of the dÊmon, their torments could neither be aggravated\n",
      "nor assuaged by human industry. If in the company of saints and angels\n",
      "they enjoyed the rewards of piety, they must have smiled at the idle\n",
      "fury of the theological insects who still crawled on the surface of the\n",
      "earth. The foremost of these insects, the emperor of the Romans, darted\n",
      "his sting, and distilled his venom, perhaps without discerning the true\n",
      "motives of Theodora and her ecclesiastical faction. The victims were no\n",
      "longer subject to his power, and the vehement style of his edicts could\n",
      "only proclaim their damnation, and invite the clergy of the East to\n",
      "join in a full chorus of curses and anathemas. The East, with some\n",
      "hesitation, consented to the voice of her sovereign: the fifth general\n",
      "council, of three patriarchs and one hundred and sixty-five bishops, was\n",
      "held at Constantinople; and the authors, as well as the defenders, of\n",
      "the three chapters were separated from the communion of the saints, and\n",
      "solemnly delivered to the prince of darkness. But the Latin churches\n",
      "were more jealous of the honor of Leo and the synod of Chalcedon: and\n",
      "if they had fought as they usually did under the standard of Rome, they\n",
      "might have prevailed in the cause of reason and humanity. But their\n",
      "chief was a prisoner in the hands of the enemy; the throne of St. Peter,\n",
      "which had been disgraced by the simony, was betrayed by the cowardice,\n",
      "of Vigilius, who yielded, after a long and inconsistent struggle, to\n",
      "the despotism of Justinian and the sophistry of the Greeks. His apostasy\n",
      "provoked the indignation of the Latins, and no more than two bishops\n",
      "could be found who would impose their hands on his deacon and successor\n",
      "Pelagius. Yet the perseverance of the popes insensibly transferred to\n",
      "their adversaries the appellation of schismatics; the Illyrian, African,\n",
      "and Italian churches were oppressed by the civil and ecclesiastical\n",
      "powers, not without some effort of military force; the distant\n",
      "Barbarians transcribed the creed of the Vatican, and, in the period of a\n",
      "century, the schism of the three chapters expired in an obscure angle of\n",
      "the Venetian province. But the religious discontent of the Italians\n",
      "had already promoted the conquests of the Lombards, and the Romans\n",
      "themselves were accustomed to suspect the faith and to detest the\n",
      "government of their Byzantine tyrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justinian was neither steady nor consistent in the nice process of\n",
      "fixing his volatile opinions and those of his subjects. In his youth he\n",
      "was, offended by the slightest deviation from the orthodox line; in\n",
      "his old age he transgressed the measure of temperate heresy, and\n",
      "the Jacobites, not less than the Catholics, were scandalized by his\n",
      "declaration, that the body of Christ was incorruptible, and that his\n",
      "manhood was never subject to any wants and infirmities, the inheritance\n",
      "of our mortal flesh. This _fantastic_ opinion was announced in the last\n",
      "edicts of Justinian; and at the moment of his seasonable departure, the\n",
      "clergy had refused to subscribe, the prince was prepared to persecute,\n",
      "and the people were resolved to suffer or resist. A bishop of Treves,\n",
      "secure beyond the limits of his power, addressed the monarch of the East\n",
      "in the language of authority and affection. \"Most gracious Justinian,\n",
      "remember your baptism and your creed. Let not your gray hairs be defiled\n",
      "with heresy. Recall your fathers from exile, and your followers from\n",
      "perdition. You cannot be ignorant, that Italy and Gaul, Spain and\n",
      "Africa, already deplore your fall, and anathematize your name. Unless,\n",
      "without delay, you destroy what you have taught; unless you exclaim\n",
      "with a loud voice, I have erred, I have sinned, anathema to Nestorius,\n",
      "anathema to Eutyches, you deliver your soul to the same flames in\n",
      "which _they_ will eternally burn.\" He died and made no sign. His death\n",
      "restored in some degree the peace of the church, and the reigns of his\n",
      "four successors, Justin Tiberius, Maurice, and Phocas, are distinguished\n",
      "by a rare, though fortunate, vacancy in the ecclesiastical history of\n",
      "the East.\n",

      "The faculties of sense and reason are least capable of acting on\n",
      "themselves; the eye is most inaccessible to the sight, the soul to the\n",
      "thought; yet we think, and even feel, that _one will_, a sole principle\n",
      "of action, is essential to a rational and conscious being. When\n",
      "Heraclius returned from the Persian war, the orthodox hero consulted his\n",
      "bishops, whether the Christ whom he adored, of one person, but of two\n",
      "natures, was actuated by a single or a double will. They replied in the\n",
      "singular, and the emperor was encouraged to hope that the Jacobites of\n",
      "Egypt and Syria might be reconciled by the profession of a doctrine,\n",
      "most certainly harmless, and most probably true, since it was taught\n",
      "even by the Nestorians themselves. The experiment was tried without\n",
      "effect, and the timid or vehement Catholics condemned even the semblance\n",
      "of a retreat in the presence of a subtle and audacious enemy. The\n",
      "orthodox (the prevailing) party devised new modes of speech, and\n",
      "argument, and interpretation: to either nature of Christ they speciously\n",
      "applied a proper and distinct energy; but the difference was no longer\n",
      "visible when they allowed that the human and the divine will were\n",
      "invariably the same. The disease was attended with the customary\n",
      "symptoms: but the Greek clergy, as if satiated with the endless\n",
      "controversy of the incarnation, instilled a healing counsel into the\n",
      "ear of the prince and people. They declared themselves monothelites,\n",
      "(asserters of the unity of will,) but they treated the words as new,\n",
      "the questions as superfluous; and recommended a religious silence as the\n",
      "most agreeable to the prudence and charity of the gospel. This law of\n",
      "silence was successively imposed by the _ecthesis_ or exposition\n",
      "of Heraclius, the _type_ or model of his grandson Constans; and the\n",
      "Imperial edicts were subscribed with alacrity or reluctance by the four\n",
      "patriarchs of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, and Antioch. But the\n",
      "bishop and monks of Jerusalem sounded the alarm: in the language, or\n",
      "even in the silence, of the Greeks, the Latin churches detected a\n",
      "latent heresy: and the obedience of Pope Honorius to the commands of\n",
      "his sovereign was retracted and censured by the bolder ignorance of his\n",
      "successors. They condemned the execrable and abominable heresy of the\n",
      "Monothelites, who revived the errors of Manes, Apollinaris, Eutyches,\n",
      "&c.; they signed the sentence of excommunication on the tomb of St.\n",
      "Peter; the ink was mingled with the sacramental wine, the blood of\n",
      "Christ; and no ceremony was omitted that could fill the superstitious\n",
      "mind with horror and affright. As the representative of the Western\n",
      "church, Pope Martin and his Lateran synod anathematized the perfidious\n",
      "and guilty silence of the Greeks: one hundred and five bishops of Italy,\n",
      "for the most part the subjects of Constans, presumed to reprobate his\n",
      "wicked _type_, and the impious _ecthesis_ of his grandfather; and to\n",
      "confound the authors and their adherents with the twenty-one notorious\n",
      "heretics, the apostates from the church, and the organs of the devil.\n",
      "Such an insult under the tamest reign could not pass with impunity.\n",
      "Pope Martin ended his days on the inhospitable shore of the Tauric\n",
      "Chersonesus, and his oracle, the abbot Maximus, was inhumanly chastised\n",
      "by the amputation of his tongue and his right hand. But the same\n",
      "invincible spirit survived in their successors; and the triumph of the\n",
      "Latins avenged their recent defeat, and obliterated the disgrace of the\n",
      "three chapters. The synods of Rome were confirmed by the sixth general\n",
      "council of Constantinople, in the palace and the presence of a new\n",
      "Constantine, a descendant of Heraclius. The royal convert converted the\n",
      "Byzantine pontiff and a majority of the bishops; the dissenters, with\n",
      "their chief, Macarius of Antioch, were condemned to the spiritual and\n",
      "temporal pains of heresy; the East condescended to accept the lessons of\n",
      "the West; and the creed was finally settled, which teaches the Catholics\n",
      "of every age, that two wills or energies are harmonized in the person of\n",
      "Christ. The majesty of the pope and the Roman synod was represented by\n",
      "two priests, one deacon, and three bishops; but these obscure Latins\n",
      "had neither arms to compel, nor treasures to bribe, nor language to\n",
      "persuade; and I am ignorant by what arts they could determine the lofty\n",
      "emperor of the Greeks to abjure the catechism of his infancy, and to\n",
      "persecute the religion of his fathers. Perhaps the monks and people of\n",
      "Constantinople were favorable to the Lateran creed, which is indeed the\n",
      "least reasonable of the two: and the suspicion is countenanced by the\n",
      "unnatural moderation of the Greek clergy, who appear in this quarrel\n",
      "to be conscious of their weakness. While the synod debated, a fanatic\n",
      "proposed a more summary decision, by raising a dead man to life: the\n",
      "prelates assisted at the trial; but the acknowledged failure may serve\n",
      "to indicate, that the passions and prejudices of the multitude were not\n",
      "enlisted on the side of the Monothelites. In the next generation,\n",
      "when the son of Constantine was deposed and slain by the disciple of\n",
      "Macarius, they tasted the feast of revenge and dominion: the image or\n",
      "monument of the sixth council was defaced, and the original acts were\n",
      "committed to the flames. But in the second year, their patron was cast\n",
      "headlong from the throne, the bishops of the East were released from\n",
      "their occasional conformity, the Roman faith was more firmly replanted\n",
      "by the orthodox successors of Bardanes, and the fine problems of the\n",
      "incarnation were forgotten in the more popular and visible quarrel of\n",
      "the worship of images.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the end of the seventh century, the creed of the incarnation,\n",
      "which had been defined at Rome and Constantinople, was uniformly\n",
      "preached in the remote islands of Britain and Ireland; the same ideas\n",
      "were entertained, or rather the same words were repeated, by all the\n",
      "Christians whose liturgy was performed in the Greek or the Latin tongue.\n",
      "Their numbers, and visible splendor, bestowed an imperfect claim to the\n",
      "appellation of Catholics: but in the East, they were marked with the\n",
      "less honorable name of _Melchites_, or Royalists; of men, whose faith,\n",
      "instead of resting on the basis of Scripture, reason, or tradition, had\n",
      "been established, and was still maintained, by the arbitrary power of\n",
      "a temporal monarch. Their adversaries might allege the words of the\n",
      "fathers of Constantinople, who profess themselves the slaves of the\n",
      "king; and they might relate, with malicious joy, how the decrees of\n",
      "Chalcedon had been inspired and reformed by the emperor Marcian and his\n",
      "virgin bride. The prevailing faction will naturally inculcate the duty\n",
      "of submission, nor is it less natural that dissenters should feel and\n",
      "assert the principles of freedom. Under the rod of persecution, the\n",
      "Nestorians and Monophysites degenerated into rebels and fugitives; and\n",
      "the most ancient and useful allies of Rome were taught to consider the\n",
      "emperor not as the chief, but as the enemy of the Christians. Language,\n",
      "the leading principle which unites or separates the tribes of mankind,\n",
      "soon discriminated the sectaries of the East, by a peculiar and\n",
      "perpetual badge, which abolished the means of intercourse and the hope\n",
      "of reconciliation. The long dominion of the Greeks, their colonies, and,\n",
      "above all, their eloquence, had propagated a language doubtless the most\n",
      "perfect that has been contrived by the art of man. Yet the body of the\n",
      "people, both in Syria and Egypt, still persevered in the use of their\n",
      "national idioms; with this difference, however, that the Coptic was\n",
      "confined to the rude and illiterate peasants of the Nile, while the\n",
      "Syriac, from the mountains of Assyria to the Red Sea, was adapted to\n",
      "the higher topics of poetry and argument. Armenia and Abyssinia were\n",
      "infected by the speech or learning of the Greeks; and their Barbaric\n",
      "tongues, which have been revived in the studies of modern Europe, were\n",
      "unintelligible to the inhabitants of the Roman empire. The Syriac\n",
      "and the Coptic, the Armenian and the ∆thiopic, are consecrated in the\n",
      "service of their respective churches: and their theology is enriched\n",
      "by domestic versions both of the Scriptures and of the most popular\n",
      "fathers. After a period of thirteen hundred and sixty years, the spark\n",
      "of controversy, first kindled by a sermon of Nestorius, still burns in\n",
      "the bosom of the East, and the hostile communions still maintain the\n",
      "faith and discipline of their founders. In the most abject state of\n",
      "ignorance, poverty, and servitude, the Nestorians and Monophysites\n",
      "reject the spiritual supremacy of Rome, and cherish the toleration of\n",
      "their Turkish masters, which allows them to anathematize, on the one\n",
      "hand, St. Cyril and the synod of Ephesus: on the other, Pope Leo and the\n",
      "council of Chalcedon. The weight which they cast into the downfall of\n",

      "the various prospect of, I. The Nestorians; II. The Jacobites; III. The\n",

      "To the three former, the Syriac is common; but of the latter, each is\n",
      "discriminated by the use of a national idiom. Yet the modern natives\n",
      "of Armenia and Abyssinia would be incapable of conversing with their\n",
      "ancestors; and the Christians of Egypt and Syria, who reject the\n",
      "religion, have adopted the language of the Arabians. The lapse of time\n",
      "has seconded the sacerdotal arts; and in the East, as well as in the\n",

      "unfortunate Nestorius was speedily obliterated. The Oriental bishops,\n",
      "who at Ephesus had resisted to his face the arrogance of Cyril,\n",
      "were mollified by his tardy concessions. The same prelates, or their\n",

      "of proselytes, who were converted from the Zendavesta to the gospel,\n",
      "from the secular to the monastic life; and their zeal was stimulated by\n",
      "the presence of an artful and formidable enemy. The Persian church\n",

      "rising generations of the faithful imbibed their theological idiom: they\n",
      "studied in the Syriac version the ten thousand volumes of Theodore of\n",
      "Mopsuestia; and they revered the apostolic faith and holy martyrdom of\n",

      "the double zeal of religion and revenge. And the rigid unity of the\n",
      "Monophysites, who, under the reigns of Zeno and Anastasius, had invaded\n",
      "the thrones of the East, provoked their antagonists, in a land of\n",
      "freedom, to avow a moral, rather than a physical, union of the two\n",
      "persons of Christ. Since the first preaching of the gospel, the\n",
      "Sassanian kings beheld with an eye of suspicion a race of aliens and\n",
      "apostates, who had embraced the religion, and who might favor the cause,\n",
      "of the hereditary foes of their country. The royal edicts had often\n",
      "prohibited their dangerous correspondence with the Syrian clergy: the\n",
      "progress of the schism was grateful to the jealous pride of Perozes, and\n",
      "he listened to the eloquence of an artful prelate, who painted Nestorius\n",
      "as the friend of Persia, and urged him to secure the fidelity of his\n",
      "Christian subjects, by granting a just preference to the victims and\n",
      "enemies of the Roman tyrant. The Nestorians composed a large majority of\n",
      "the clergy and people: they were encouraged by the smile, and armed with\n",
      "the sword, of despotism; yet many of their weaker brethren were startled\n",
      "at the thought of breaking loose from the communion of the Christian\n",
      "world, and the blood of seven thousand seven hundred Monophysites,\n",
      "or Catholics, confirmed the uniformity of faith and discipline in the\n",
      "churches of Persia. Their ecclesiastical institutions are distinguished\n",
      "by a liberal principle of reason, or at least of policy: the austerity\n",
      "of the cloister was relaxed and gradually forgotten; houses of charity\n",
      "were endowed for the education of orphans and foundlings; the law\n",
      "of celibacy, so forcibly recommended to the Greeks and Latins, was\n",
      "disregarded by the Persian clergy; and the number of the elect was\n",
      "multiplied by the public and reiterated nuptials of the priests, the\n",
      "bishops, and even the patriarch himself. To this standard of natural and\n",
      "religious freedom, myriads of fugitives resorted from all the provinces\n",
      "of the Eastern empire; the narrow bigotry of Justinian was punished by\n",
      "the emigration of his most industrious subjects; they transported into\n",
      "Persia the arts both of peace and war: and those who deserved the favor,\n",
      "were promoted in the service, of a discerning monarch. The arms of\n",
      "Nushirvan, and his fiercer grandson, were assisted with advice, and\n",
      "money, and troops, by the desperate sectaries who still lurked in their\n",
      "native cities of the East: their zeal was rewarded with the gift of the\n",
      "Catholic churches; but when those cities and churches were recovered by\n",
      "Heraclius, their open profession of treason and heresy compelled them\n",
      "to seek a refuge in the realm of their foreign ally. But the seeming\n",
      "tranquillity of the Nestorians was often endangered, and sometimes\n",
      "overthrown. They were involved in the common evils of Oriental\n",
      "despotism: their enmity to Rome could not always atone for their\n",
      "attachment to the gospel: and a colony of three hundred thousand\n",
      "Jacobites, the captives of Apamea and Antioch, was permitted to erect a\n",
      "hostile altar in the face of the _catholic_, and in the sunshine of the\n",
      "court. In his last treaty, Justinian introduced some conditions which\n",
      "tended to enlarge and fortify the toleration of Christianity in Persia.\n",
      "The emperor, ignorant of the rights of conscience, was incapable of pity\n",
      "or esteem for the heretics who denied the authority of the holy synods:\n",
      "but he flattered himself that they would gradually perceive the temporal\n",
      "benefits of union with the empire and the church of Rome; and if\n",
      "he failed in exciting their gratitude, he might hope to provoke the\n",
      "jealousy of their sovereign. In a later age the Lutherans have been\n",
      "burnt at Paris, and protected in Germany, by the superstition and policy\n",
      "of the most Christian king.\n",

      "The desire of gaining souls for God and subjects for the church, has\n",
      "excited in every age the diligence of the Christian priests. From the\n",
      "conquest of Persia they carried their spiritual arms to the north, the\n",
      "east, and the south; and the simplicity of the gospel was fashioned and\n",
      "painted with the colors of the Syriac theology. In the sixth century,\n",
      "according to the report of a Nestorian traveller, Christianity was\n",
      "successfully preached to the Bactrians, the Huns, the Persians, the\n",
      "Indians, the Persarmenians, the Medes, and the Elamites: the Barbaric\n",
      "churches, from the Gulf of Persia to the Caspian Sea, were almost\n",
      "infinite; and their recent faith was conspicuous in the number and\n",
      "sanctity of their monks and martyrs. The pepper coast of Malabar,\n",
      "and the isles of the ocean, Socotora and Ceylon, were peopled with an\n",
      "increasing multitude of Christians; and the bishops and clergy of\n",
      "those sequestered regions derived their ordination from the Catholic of\n",
      "Babylon. In a subsequent age the zeal of the Nestorians overleaped the\n",
      "limits which had confined the ambition and curiosity both of the Greeks\n",
      "and Persians. The missionaries of Balch and Samarcand pursued without\n",
      "fear the footsteps of the roving Tartar, and insinuated themselves into\n",
      "the camps of the valleys of Imaus and the banks of the Selinga. They\n",
      "exposed a metaphysical creed to those illiterate shepherds: to those\n",
      "sanguinary warriors, they recommended humanity and repose. Yet a khan,\n",
      "whose power they vainly magnified, is said to have received at their\n",
      "hands the rites of baptism, and even of ordination; and the fame of\n",
      "_Prester_ or _Presbyter_ John has long amused the credulity of Europe.\n",
      "The royal convert was indulged in the use of a portable altar; but he\n",
      "despatched an embassy to the patriarch, to inquire how, in the season of\n",
      "Lent, he should abstain from animal food, and how he might celebrate\n",
      "the Eucharist in a desert that produced neither corn nor wine. In their\n",
      "progress by sea and land, the Nestorians entered China by the port of\n",
      "Canton and the northern residence of Sigan. Unlike the senators of\n",
      "Rome, who assumed with a smile the characters of priests and augurs, the\n",
      "mandarins, who affect in public the reason of philosophers, are devoted\n",
      "in private to every mode of popular superstition. They cherished and\n",
      "they confounded the gods of Palestine and of India; but the propagation\n",
      "of Christianity awakened the jealousy of the state, and, after a short\n",
      "vicissitude of favor and persecution, the foreign sect expired in\n",
      "ignorance and oblivion. Under the reign of the caliphs, the Nestorian\n",
      "church was diffused from China to Jerusalem and Cyrus; and their\n",
      "numbers, with those of the Jacobites, were computed to surpass the Greek\n",
      "and Latin communions. Twenty-five metropolitans or archbishops composed\n",
      "their hierarchy; but several of these were dispensed, by the distance\n",
      "and danger of the way, from the duty of personal attendance, on the\n",
      "easy condition that every six years they should testify their faith and\n",
      "obedience to the catholic or patriarch of Babylon, a vague appellation\n",
      "which has been successively applied to the royal seats of Seleucia,\n",
      "Ctesiphon, and Bagdad. These remote branches are long since withered;\n",
      "and the old patriarchal trunk is now divided by the _Elijahs_ of\n",
      "Mosul, the representatives almost on lineal descent of the genuine and\n",
      "primitive succession; the _Josephs_ of Amida, who are reconciled to the\n",
      "church of Rome: and the _Simeons_ of Van or Ormia, whose revolt, at the\n",
      "head of forty thousand families, was promoted in the sixteenth century\n",
      "by the Sophis of Persia. The number of three hundred thousand is allowed\n",
      "for the whole body of the Nestorians, who, under the name of Chaldeans\n",
      "or Assyrians, are confounded with the most learned or the most powerful\n",
      "nation of Eastern antiquity.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the legend of antiquity, the gospel was preached in India\n",
      "by St. Thomas. At the end of the ninth century, his shrine, perhaps in\n",
      "the neighborhood of Madras, was devoutly visited by the ambassadors of\n",
      "Alfred; and their return with a cargo of pearls and spices rewarded the\n",
      "zeal of the English monarch, who entertained the largest projects of\n",
      "trade and discovery. When the Portuguese first opened the navigation\n",
      "of India, the Christians of St. Thomas had been seated for ages on\n",
      "the coast of Malabar, and the difference of their character and color\n",
      "attested the mixture of a foreign race. In arms, in arts, and possibly\n",
      "in virtue, they excelled the natives of Hindostan; the husbandmen\n",
      "cultivated the palm-tree, the merchants were enriched by the pepper\n",
      "trade, the soldiers preceded the _nairs_ or nobles of Malabar, and their\n",
      "hereditary privileges were respected by the gratitude or the fear of the\n",
      "king of Cochin and the Zamorin himself. They acknowledged a Gentoo of\n",
      "sovereign, but they were governed, even in temporal concerns, by the\n",
      "bishop of Angamala. He still asserted his ancient title of metropolitan\n",
      "of India, but his real jurisdiction was exercised in fourteen hundred\n",
      "churches, and he was intrusted with the care of two hundred thousand\n",
      "souls. Their religion would have rendered them the firmest and most\n",
      "cordial allies of the Portuguese; but the inquisitors soon discerned\n",
      "in the Christians of St. Thomas the unpardonable guilt of heresy and\n",
      "schism. Instead of owning themselves the subjects of the Roman pontiff,\n",
      "the spiritual and temporal monarch of the globe, they adhered, like\n",
      "their ancestors, to the communion of the Nestorian patriarch; and the\n",
      "bishops whom he ordained at Mosul, traversed the dangers of the sea and\n",
      "land to reach their diocese on the coast of Malabar. In their Syriac\n",
      "liturgy the names of Theodore and Nestorius were piously commemorated:\n",
      "they united their adoration of the two persons of Christ; the title\n",
      "of Mother of God was offensive to their ear, and they measured with\n",
      "scrupulous avarice the honors of the Virgin Mary, whom the superstition\n",
      "of the Latins had almost exalted to the rank of a goddess. When\n",
      "her image was first presented to the disciples of St. Thomas, they\n",
      "indignantly exclaimed, \"We are Christians, not idolaters!\" and their\n",
      "simple devotion was content with the veneration of the cross. Their\n",
      "separation from the Western world had left them in ignorance of the\n",
      "improvements, or corruptions, of a thousand years; and their conformity\n",
      "with the faith and practice of the fifth century would equally\n",
      "disappoint the prejudices of a Papist or a Protestant. It was the first\n",
      "care of the ministers of Rome to intercept all correspondence with the\n",
      "Nestorian patriarch, and several of his bishops expired in the prisons\n",
      "of the holy office. The flock, without a shepherd, was assaulted by the\n",
      "power of the Portuguese, the arts of the Jesuits, and the zeal of Alexis\n",
      "de Menezes, archbishop of Goa, in his personal visitation of the coast\n",
      "of Malabar. The synod of Diamper, at which he presided, consummated\n",
      "the pious work of the reunion; and rigorously imposed the doctrine and\n",
      "discipline of the Roman church, without forgetting auricular confession,\n",
      "the strongest engine of ecclesiastical torture. The memory of Theodore\n",
      "and Nestorius was condemned, and Malabar was reduced under the dominion\n",
      "of the pope, of the primate, and of the Jesuits who invaded the see\n",
      "of Angamala or Cranganor. Sixty years of servitude and hypocrisy were\n",
      "patiently endured; but as soon as the Portuguese empire was shaken by\n",
      "the courage and industry of the Dutch, the Nestorians asserted, with\n",
      "vigor and effect, the religion of their fathers. The Jesuits were\n",
      "incapable of defending the power which they had abused; the arms of\n",
      "forty thousand Christians were pointed against their falling tyrants;\n",
      "and the Indian archdeacon assumed the character of bishop till a fresh\n",
      "supply of episcopal gifts and Syriac missionaries could be obtained from\n",
      "the patriarch of Babylon. Since the expulsion of the Portuguese, the\n",
      "Nestorian creed is freely professed on the coast of Malabar. The trading\n",
      "companies of Holland and England are the friends of toleration; but\n",
      "if oppression be less mortifying than contempt, the Christians of St.\n",
      "Thomas have reason to complain of the cold and silent indifference of\n",
      "their brethren of Europe.\n",

      "II. The history of the Monophysites is less copious and interesting than\n",
      "that of the Nestorians. Under the reigns of Zeno and Anastasius, their\n",
      "artful leaders surprised the ear of the prince, usurped the thrones of\n",
      "the East, and crushed on its native soil the school of the Syrians. The\n",
      "rule of the Monophysite faith was defined with exquisite discretion\n",
      "by Severus, patriarch of Antioch: he condemned, in the style of the\n",
      "Henoticon, the adverse heresies of Nestorius; and Eutyches maintained\n",
      "against the latter the reality of the body of Christ, and constrained\n",
      "the Greeks to allow that he was a liar who spoke truth. But the\n",
      "approximation of ideas could not abate the vehemence of passion; each\n",
      "party was the more astonished that their blind antagonist could dispute\n",
      "on so trifling a difference; the tyrant of Syria enforced the belief of\n",
      "his creed, and his reign was polluted with the blood of three hundred\n",
      "and fifty monks, who were slain, not perhaps without provocation or\n",
      "resistance, under the walls of Apamea. The successor of Anastasius\n",
      "replanted the orthodox standard in the East; Severus fled into\n",
      "Egypt; and his friend, the eloquent Xenaias, who had escaped from the\n",
      "Nestorians of Persia, was suffocated in his exile by the Melchites of\n",
      "Paphlagonia. Fifty-four bishops were swept from their thrones, eight\n",
      "hundred ecclesiastics were cast into prison, and notwithstanding the\n",
      "ambiguous favor of Theodora, the Oriental flocks, deprived of their\n",
      "shepherds, must insensibly have been either famished or poisoned. In\n",
      "this spiritual distress, the expiring faction was revived, and united,\n",
      "and perpetuated, by the labors of a monk; and the name of James BaradÊus\n",
      "has been preserved in the appellation of _Jacobites_, a familiar sound,\n",
      "which may startle the ear of an English reader. From the holy confessors\n",
      "in their prison of Constantinople, he received the powers of bishop of\n",
      "Edessa and apostle of the East, and the ordination of fourscore thousand\n",
      "bishops, priests, and deacons, is derived from the same inexhaustible\n",
      "source. The speed of the zealous missionary was promoted by the fleetest\n",
      "dromedaries of a devout chief of the Arabs; the doctrine and discipline\n",
      "of the Jacobites were secretly established in the dominions of\n",
      "Justinian; and each Jacobite was compelled to violate the laws and to\n",
      "hate the Roman legislator. The successors of Severus, while they lurked\n",
      "in convents or villages, while they sheltered their proscribed heads in\n",
      "the caverns of hermits, or the tents of the Saracens, still asserted,\n",
      "as they now assert, their indefeasible right to the title, the rank, and\n",
      "the prerogatives of patriarch of Antioch: under the milder yoke of\n",
      "the infidels, they reside about a league from Merdin, in the pleasant\n",
      "monastery of Zapharan, which they have embellished with cells,\n",
      "aqueducts, and plantations. The secondary, though honorable, place is\n",
      "filled by the _maphrian_, who, in his station at Mosul itself, defies\n",
      "the Nestorian _catholic_ with whom he contests the primacy of the East.\n",
      "Under the patriarch and the maphrian, one hundred and fifty archbishops\n",
      "and bishops have been counted in the different ages of the Jacobite\n",
      "church; but the order of the hierarchy is relaxed or dissolved, and the\n",
      "greater part of their dioceses is confined to the neighborhood of the\n",
      "Euphrates and the Tigris. The cities of Aleppo and Amida, which are\n",
      "often visited by the patriarch, contain some wealthy merchants and\n",
      "industrious mechanics, but the multitude derive their scanty sustenance\n",
      "from their daily labor: and poverty, as well as superstition, may impose\n",
      "their excessive fasts: five annual lents, during which both the clergy\n",
      "and laity abstain not only from flesh or eggs, but even from the taste\n",
      "of wine, of oil, and of fish. Their present numbers are esteemed from\n",
      "fifty to fourscore thousand souls, the remnant of a populous church,\n",
      "which was gradually decreased under the impression of twelve centuries.\n",
      "Yet in that long period, some strangers of merit have been converted\n",
      "to the Monophysite faith, and a Jew was the father of Abulpharagius,\n",
      "primate of the East, so truly eminent both in his life and death. In his\n",
      "life he was an elegant writer of the Syriac and Arabic tongues, a poet,\n",
      "physician, and historian, a subtile philosopher, and a moderate divine.\n",
      "In his death, his funeral was attended by his rival the Nestorian\n",
      "patriarch, with a train of Greeks and Armenians, who forgot their\n",
      "disputes, and mingled their tears over the grave of an enemy. The sect\n",
      "which was honored by the virtues of Abulpharagius appears, however, to\n",
      "sink below the level of their Nestorian brethren. The superstition of\n",
      "the Jacobites is more abject, their fasts more rigid, their intestine\n",
      "divisions are more numerous, and their doctors (as far as I can measure\n",
      "the degrees of nonsense) are more remote from the precincts of reason.\n",
      "Something may possibly be allowed for the rigor of the Monophysite\n",
      "theology; much more for the superior influence of the monastic order.\n",
      "In Syria, in Egypt, in Ethiopia, the Jacobite monks have ever been\n",
      "distinguished by the austerity of their penance and the absurdity of\n",
      "their legends. Alive or dead, they are worshipped as the favorites of\n",
      "the Deity; the crosier of bishop and patriarch is reserved for their\n",
      "venerable hands; and they assume the government of men, while they are\n",
      "yet reeking with the habits and prejudices of the cloister.\n",
      "\n",
      "III. In the style of the Oriental Christians, the Monothelites of every\n",
      "age are described under the appellation of _Maronites_, a name which\n",
      "has been insensibly transferred from a hermit to a monastery, from a\n",
      "monastery to a nation. Maron, a saint or savage of the fifth century,\n",
      "displayed his religious madness in Syria; the rival cities of Apamea and\n",
      "Emesa disputed his relics, a stately church was erected on his tomb, and\n",
      "six hundred of his disciples united their solitary cells on the banks\n",
      "of the Orontes. In the controversies of the incarnation they nicely\n",
      "threaded the orthodox line between the sects of Nestorians and Eutyches;\n",
      "but the unfortunate question of _one will_ or operation in the two\n",
      "natures of Christ, was generated by their curious leisure. Their\n",
      "proselyte, the emperor Heraclius, was rejected as a Maronite from the\n",
      "walls of Emesa, he found a refuge in the monastery of his brethren;\n",
      "and their theological lessons were repaid with the gift a spacious and\n",
      "wealthy domain. The name and doctrine of this venerable school were\n",
      "propagated among the Greeks and Syrians, and their zeal is expressed\n",
      "by Macarius, patriarch of Antioch, who declared before the synod of\n",
      "Constantinople, that sooner than subscribe the _two wills_ of Christ, he\n",
      "would submit to be hewn piecemeal and cast into the sea. A similar or a\n",
      "less cruel mode of persecution soon converted the unresisting subjects\n",
      "of the plain, while the glorious title of _Mardaites_, or rebels, was\n",
      "bravely maintained by the hardy natives of Mount Libanus. John Maron,\n",
      "one of the most learned and popular of the monks, assumed the character\n",
      "of patriarch of Antioch; his nephew, Abraham, at the head of the\n",
      "Maronites, defended their civil and religious freedom against the\n",
      "tyrants of the East. The son of the orthodox Constantine pursued with\n",
      "pious hatred a people of soldiers, who might have stood the bulwark of\n",
      "his empire against the common foes of Christ and of Rome. An army of\n",
      "Greeks invaded Syria; the monastery of St. Maron was destroyed with\n",
      "fire; the bravest chieftains were betrayed and murdered, and twelve\n",
      "thousand of their followers were transplanted to the distant frontiers\n",
      "of Armenia and Thrace. Yet the humble nation of the Maronites had\n",
      "survived the empire of Constantinople, and they still enjoy, under\n",
      "their Turkish masters, a free religion and a mitigated servitude. Their\n",
      "domestic governors are chosen among the ancient nobility: the patriarch,\n",
      "in his monastery of Canobin, still fancies himself on the throne of\n",
      "Antioch: nine bishops compose his synod, and one hundred and fifty\n",
      "priests, who retain the liberty of marriage, are intrusted with the care\n",
      "of one hundred thousand souls. Their country extends from the ridge of\n",
      "Mount Libanus to the shores of Tripoli; and the gradual descent affords,\n",
      "in a narrow space, each variety of soil and climate, from the Holy\n",
      "Cedars, erect under the weight of snow, to the vine, the mulberry, and\n",
      "the olive-trees of the fruitful valley. In the twelfth century, the\n",
      "Maronites, abjuring the Monothelite error were reconciled to the Latin\n",
      "churches of Antioch and Rome, and the same alliance has been frequently\n",
      "renewed by the ambition of the popes and the distress of the Syrians.\n",
      "But it may reasonably be questioned, whether their union has ever been\n",
      "perfect or sincere; and the learned Maronites of the college of Rome\n",
      "have vainly labored to absolve their ancestors from the guilt of heresy\n",
      "and schism.\n",
      "\n",
      "IV. Since the age of Constantine, the Armenians had signalized their\n",
      "attachment to the religion and empire of the Christians. The disorders\n",
      "of their country, and their ignorance of the Greek tongue, prevented\n",
      "their clergy from assisting at the synod of Chalcedon, and they floated\n",
      "eighty-four years in a state of indifference or suspense, till their\n",
      "vacant faith was finally occupied by the missionaries of Julian of\n",
      "Halicarnassus, who in Egypt, their common exile, had been vanquished\n",
      "by the arguments or the influence of his rival Severus, the Monophysite\n",
      "patriarch of Antioch. The Armenians alone are the pure disciples of\n",
      "Eutyches, an unfortunate parent, who has been renounced by the greater\n",
      "part of his spiritual progeny. They alone persevere in the opinion, that\n",
      "the manhood of Christ was created, or existed without creation, of a\n",
      "divine and incorruptible substance. Their adversaries reproach them with\n",
      "the adoration of a phantom; and they retort the accusation, by deriding\n",
      "or execrating the blasphemy of the Jacobites, who impute to the Godhead\n",
      "the vile infirmities of the flesh, even the natural effects of nutrition\n",
      "and digestion. The religion of Armenia could not derive much glory from\n",
      "the learning or the power of its inhabitants. The royalty expired with\n",
      "the origin of their schism; and their Christian kings, who arose and\n",
      "fell in the thirteenth century on the confines of Cilicia, were the\n",
      "clients of the Latins and the vassals of the Turkish sultan of Iconium.\n",

      "_incorruptibles_, and on the death of the patriarch, the two factions\n",

      "favor of the empress Theodora, and the arms of the eunuch Narses, which\n",
      "might have been used in more honorable warfare. The exile of the popular\n",

      "and after a schism of one hundred and seventy years, the _Gaianites_\n",
      "still revered the memory and doctrine of their founder. The strength of\n",
      "numbers and of discipline was tried in a desperate and bloody conflict;\n",

      "the pious women, ascending the roofs of their houses, showered down\n",
      "every sharp or ponderous utensil on the heads of the enemy; and the\n",
      "final victory of Narses was owing to the flames, with which he wasted\n",
      "the third capital of the Roman world. But the lieutenant of Justinian\n",
      "had not conquered in the cause of a heretic; Theodosius himself was\n",
      "speedily, though gently, removed; and Paul of Tanis, an orthodox monk,\n",
      "was raised to the throne of Athanasius. The powers of government were\n",
      "strained in his support; he might appoint or displace the dukes and\n",
      "tribunes of Egypt; the allowance of bread, which Diocletian had granted,\n",
      "was suppressed, the churches were shut, and a nation of schismatics was\n",
      "deprived at once of their spiritual and carnal food. In his turn, the\n",
      "tyrant was excommunicated by the zeal and revenge of the people:\n",

      "of seven hundred pounds of gold, his restoration to the same station of\n",
      "hatred and ignominy. His successor Apollinaris entered the hostile city\n",
      "in military array, alike qualified for prayer or for battle. His troops,\n",
      "under arms, were distributed through the streets; the gates of the\n",

      "to defend the person of their chief. He stood erect on his throne, and,\n",
      "throwing aside the upper garment of a warrior, suddenly appeared before\n",
      "the eyes of the multitude in the robes of patriarch of Alexandria.\n",
      "Astonishment held them mute; but no sooner had Apollinaris begun to\n",
      "read the tome of St. Leo, than a volley of curses, and invectives, and\n",
      "stones, assaulted the odious minister of the emperor and the synod.\n",
      "A charge was instantly sounded by the successor of the apostles;\n",
      "the soldiers waded to their knees in blood; and two hundred thousand\n",
      "Christians are said to have fallen by the sword: an incredible account,\n",
      "even if it be extended from the slaughter of a day to the eighteen years\n",
      "of the reign of Apollinaris. Two succeeding patriarchs, Eulogius and\n",
      "John, labored in the conversion of heretics, with arms and arguments\n",
      "more worthy of their evangelical profession. The theological knowledge\n",
      "of Eulogius was displayed in many a volume, which magnified the errors\n",
      "of Eutyches and Severus, and attempted to reconcile the ambiguous\n",
      "language of St. Cyril with the orthodox creed of Pope Leo and the\n",
      "fathers of Chalcedon. The bounteous alms of John the eleemosynary were\n",

      "his orders, at a distance from Alexandria, were obeyed only under the\n",
      "pressure of military force. A generous effort might have redeemed the\n",
      "religion and liberty of Egypt, and her six hundred monasteries might\n",
      "have poured forth their myriads of holy warriors, for whom death should\n",

      "a voice, which bade him expect, at the end of ten years, the aid of a\n",

      "VI. The Coptic patriarch, a rebel to the CÊsars, or a slave to the\n",

      "pour out or restrain the waters of the Nile; and the peace and plenty\n",
      "of Egypt was obtained, even in this world, by the intercession of the\n",

      "Melchite and a Jacobite, embarked at the same time; but the empress,\n",
      "from a motive of love or fear, was more effectually obeyed; and the\n",
      "Catholic priest was detained by the president of Thebais, while the king\n",
      "of Nubia and his court were hastily baptized in the faith of Dioscorus.\n",
      "The tardy envoy of Justinian was received and dismissed with honor:\n",

      "negro convert was instructed to reply that he would never abandon his\n",

      "are still visible in the savage towns of Sennaar and Dongola. But the\n",
      "Nubians at length executed their threats of returning to the worship of\n",

      "finally preferred the triumph of the Koran to the abasement of the\n",

      "Christianity was more deeply rooted in the Abyssinian empire; and,\n",
      "although the correspondence has been sometimes interrupted above seventy\n",
      "or a hundred years, the mother-church of Alexandria retains her colony\n",
      "in a state of perpetual pupilage. Seven bishops once composed the\n",
      "∆thiopic synod: had their number amounted to ten, they might have\n",
      "elected an independent primate; and one of their kings was ambitious of\n",
      "promoting his brother to the ecclesiastical throne. But the event\n",
      "was foreseen, the increase was denied: the episcopal office has been\n",
      "gradually confined to the _abuna_, the head and author of the Abyssinian\n",
      "priesthood; the patriarch supplies each vacancy with an Egyptian monk;\n",
      "and the character of a stranger appears more venerable in the eyes\n",
      "of the people, less dangerous in those of the monarch. In the sixth\n",
      "century, when the schism of Egypt was confirmed, the rival chiefs, with\n",
      "their patrons, Justinian and Theodora, strove to outstrip each other in\n",
      "the conquest of a remote and independent province. The industry of the\n",
      "empress was again victorious, and the pious Theodora has established\n",
      "in that sequestered church the faith and discipline of the Jacobites.\n",
      "Encompassed on all sides by the enemies of their religion, the\n",
      "∆thiopians slept near a thousand years, forgetful of the world, by whom\n",
      "they were forgotten. They were awakened by the Portuguese, who, turning\n",
      "the southern promontory of Africa, appeared in India and the Red Sea,\n",
      "as if they had descended through the air from a distant planet. In the\n",
      "first moments of their interview, the subjects of Rome and Alexandria\n",
      "observed the resemblance, rather than the difference, of their faith;\n",
      "and each nation expected the most important benefits from an alliance\n",
      "with their Christian brethren. In their lonely situation, the ∆thiopians\n",
      "had almost relapsed into the savage life. Their vessels, which had\n",
      "traded to Ceylon, scarcely presumed to navigate the rivers of Africa;\n",
      "the ruins of Axume were deserted, the nation was scattered in villages,\n",
      "and the emperor, a pompous name, was content, both in peace and\n",
      "war, with the immovable residence of a camp. Conscious of their own\n",
      "indigence, the Abyssinians had formed the rational project of importing\n",
      "the arts and ingenuity of Europe; and their ambassadors at Rome and\n",
      "Lisbon were instructed to solicit a colony of smiths, carpenters,\n",
      "tilers, masons, printers, surgeons, and physicians, for the use of their\n",
      "country. But the public danger soon called for the instant and effectual\n",
      "aid of arms and soldiers, to defend an unwarlike people from the\n",
      "Barbarians who ravaged the inland country and the Turks and Arabs who\n",
      "advanced from the sea-coast in more formidable array. ∆thiopia was saved\n",
      "by four hundred and fifty Portuguese, who displayed in the field the\n",
      "native valor of Europeans, and the artificial power of the musket and\n",
      "cannon. In a moment of terror, the emperor had promised to reconcile\n",
      "himself and his subjects to the Catholic faith; a Latin patriarch\n",
      "represented the supremacy of the pope: the empire, enlarged in a tenfold\n",
      "proportion, was supposed to contain more gold than the mines of America;\n",
      "and the wildest hopes of avarice and zeal were built on the willing\n",
      "submission of the Christians of Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the vows which pain had extorted were forsworn on the return of\n",
      "health. The Abyssinians still adhered with unshaken constancy to the\n",
      "Monophysite faith; their languid belief was inflamed by the exercise\n",
      "of dispute; they branded the Latins with the names of Arians and\n",
      "Nestorians, and imputed the adoration of _four_ gods to those who\n",
      "separated the two natures of Christ. Fremona, a place of worship, or\n",
      "rather of exile, was assigned to the Jesuit missionaries. Their skill\n",
      "in the liberal and mechanic arts, their theological learning, and the\n",
      "decency of their manners, inspired a barren esteem; but they were\n",
      "not endowed with the gift of miracles, and they vainly solicited a\n",
      "reÎnforcement of European troops. The patience and dexterity of forty\n",
      "years at length obtained a more favorable audience, and two emperors\n",
      "of Abyssinia were persuaded that Rome could insure the temporal and\n",
      "everlasting happiness of her votaries. The first of these royal converts\n",
      "lost his crown and his life; and the rebel army was sanctified by\n",
      "the _abuna_, who hurled an anathema at the apostate, and absolved his\n",
      "subjects from their oath of fidelity. The fate of Zadenghel was revenged\n",
      "by the courage and fortune of Susneus, who ascended the throne under the\n",
      "name of Segued, and more vigorously prosecuted the pious enterprise of\n",
      "his kinsman. After the amusement of some unequal combats between the\n",
      "Jesuits and his illiterate priests, the emperor declared himself a\n",
      "proselyte to the synod of Chalcedon, presuming that his clergy and\n",
      "people would embrace without delay the religion of their prince. The\n",
      "liberty of choice was succeeded by a law, which imposed, under pain of\n",
      "death, the belief of the two natures of Christ: the Abyssinians were\n",
      "enjoined to work and to play on the Sabbath; and Segued, in the face of\n",
      "Europe and Africa, renounced his connection with the Alexandrian church.\n",
      "A Jesuit, Alphonso Mendez, the Catholic patriarch of ∆thiopia, accepted,\n",
      "in the name of Urban VIII., the homage and abjuration of the penitent.\n",
      "\"I confess,\" said the emperor on his knees, \"I confess that the pope is\n",
      "the vicar of Christ, the successor of St. Peter, and the sovereign of\n",
      "the world. To him I swear true obedience, and at his feet I offer\n",
      "my person and kingdom.\" A similar oath was repeated by his son, his\n",
      "brother, the clergy, the nobles, and even the ladies of the court:\n",
      "the Latin patriarch was invested with honors and wealth; and his\n",
      "missionaries erected their churches or citadels in the most convenient\n",
      "stations of the empire. The Jesuits themselves deplore the fatal\n",
      "indiscretion of their chief, who forgot the mildness of the gospel and\n",
      "the policy of his order, to introduce with hasty violence the liturgy of\n",
      "Rome and the inquisition of Portugal. He condemned the ancient practice\n",
      "of circumcision, which health, rather than superstition, had first\n",
      "invented in the climate of ∆thiopia. A new baptism, a new ordination,\n",
      "was inflicted on the natives; and they trembled with horror when\n",
      "the most holy of the dead were torn from their graves, when the most\n",
      "illustrious of the living were excommunicated by a foreign priest. In\n",
      "the defense of their religion and liberty, the Abyssinians rose in arms,\n",
      "with desperate but unsuccessful zeal. Five rebellions were extinguished\n",
      "in the blood of the insurgents: two abunas were slain in battle, whole\n",
      "legions were slaughtered in the field, or suffocated in their caverns;\n",
      "and neither merit, nor rank, nor sex, could save from an ignominious\n",
      "death the enemies of Rome. But the victorious monarch was finally\n",
      "subdued by the constancy of the nation, of his mother, of his son, and\n",
      "of his most faithful friends. Segued listened to the voice of pity,\n",
      "of reason, perhaps of fear: and his edict of liberty of conscience\n",
      "instantly revealed the tyranny and weakness of the Jesuits. On the death\n",
      "of his father, Basilides expelled the Latin patriarch, and restored\n",
      "to the wishes of the nation the faith and the discipline of Egypt. The\n",
      "Monophysite churches resounded with a song of triumph, \"that the sheep\n",

      "that of the Rhine, which loses itself in the sands, before its waters\n",
      "can mingle with the ocean. The scale of dominion is diminished to our\n",
      "view by the distance of time and place; nor is the loss of external\n",
      "splendor compensated by the nobler gifts of virtue and genius. In the\n",
      "last moments of her decay, Constantinople was doubtless more opulent and\n",
      "populous than Athens at her most flourishing Êra, when a scanty sum of\n",
      "six thousand talents, or twelve hundred thousand pounds sterling was\n",
      "possessed by twenty-one thousand male citizens of an adult age. But each\n",
      "of these citizens was a freeman, who dared to assert the liberty of his\n",
      "thoughts, words, and actions, whose person and property were guarded by\n",
      "equal law; and who exercised his independent vote in the government\n",
      "of the republic. Their numbers seem to be multiplied by the strong and\n",
      "various discriminations of character; under the shield of freedom, on\n",
      "the wings of emulation and vanity, each Athenian aspired to the level of\n",
      "the national dignity; from this commanding eminence, some chosen spirits\n",
      "soared beyond the reach of a vulgar eye; and the chances of superior\n",
      "merit in a great and populous kingdom, as they are proved by experience,\n",
      "would excuse the computation of imaginary millions. The territories of\n",
      "Athens, Sparta, and their allies, do not exceed a moderate province of\n",
      "France or England; but after the trophies of Salamis and Platea,\n",
      "they expand in our fancy to the gigantic size of Asia, which had been\n",
      "trampled under the feet of the victorious Greeks. But the subjects of\n",
      "the Byzantine empire, who assume and dishonor the names both of Greeks\n",
      "and Romans, present a dead uniformity of abject vices, which are neither\n",
      "softened by the weakness of humanity, nor animated by the vigor of\n",
      "memorable crimes. The freemen of antiquity might repeat with generous\n",
      "enthusiasm the sentence of Homer, \"that on the first day of his\n",
      "servitude, the captive is deprived of one half of his manly virtue.\"\n",
      "But the poet had only seen the effects of civil or domestic slavery, nor\n",
      "could he foretell that the second moiety of manhood must be annihilated\n",
      "by the spiritual despotism which shackles not only the actions, but even\n",
      "the thoughts, of the prostrate votary. By this double yoke, the Greeks\n",
      "were oppressed under the successors of Heraclius; the tyrant, a law of\n",
      "eternal justice, was degraded by the vices of his subjects; and on the\n",
      "throne, in the camp, in the schools, we search, perhaps with fruitless\n",
      "diligence, the names and characters that may deserve to be rescued from\n",
      "oblivion. Nor are the defects of the subject compensated by the skill\n",
      "and variety of the painters. Of a space of eight hundred years, the four\n",
      "first centuries are overspread with a cloud interrupted by some faint\n",
      "and broken rays of historic light: in the lives of the emperors, from\n",
      "Maurice to Alexius, Basil the Macedonian has alone been the theme of a\n",
      "separate work; and the absence, or loss, or imperfection of contemporary\n",
      "evidence, must be poorly supplied by the doubtful authority of more\n",
      "recent compilers. The four last centuries are exempt from the reproach\n",
      "of penury; and with the Comnenian family, the historic muse of\n",
      "Constantinople again revives, but her apparel is gaudy, her motions are\n",
      "without elegance or grace. A succession of priests, or courtiers,\n",
      "treads in each other's footsteps in the same path of servitude and\n",
      "superstition: their views are narrow, their judgment is feeble or\n",
      "corrupt; and we close the volume of copious barrenness, still ignorant\n",
      "of the causes of events, the characters of the actors, and the manners\n",
      "of the times which they celebrate or deplore. The observation which\n",
      "has been applied to a man, may be extended to a whole people, that the\n",
      "energy of the sword is communicated to the pen; and it will be found by\n",
      "experience, that the tone of history will rise or fall with the spirit\n",
      "of the age.\n",
      "\n",
      "From these considerations, I should have abandoned without regret the\n",
      "Greek slaves and their servile historians, had I not reflected that the\n",
      "fate of the Byzantine monarchy is _passively_ connected with the most\n",
      "splendid and important revolutions which have changed the state of the\n",
      "world. The space of the lost provinces was immediately replenished with\n",
      "new colonies and rising kingdoms: the active virtues of peace and war\n",
      "deserted from the vanquished to the victorious nations; and it is in\n",
      "their origin and conquests, in their religion and government, that\n",
      "we must explore the causes and effects of the decline and fall of the\n",
      "Eastern empire. Nor will this scope of narrative, the riches and\n",
      "variety of these materials, be incompatible with the unity of design\n",
      "and composition. As, in his daily prayers, the Mussulman of Fez or Delhi\n",
      "still turns his face towards the temple of Mecca, the historian's eye\n",
      "shall be always fixed on the city of Constantinople. The excursive line\n",
      "may embrace the wilds of Arabia and Tartary, but the circle will be\n",
      "ultimately reduced to the decreasing limit of the Roman monarchy.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this principle I shall now establish the plan of the last two volumes\n",
      "of the present work. The first chapter will contain, in a regular\n",
      "series, the emperors who reigned at Constantinople during a period of\n",
      "six hundred years, from the days of Heraclius to the Latin conquest;\n",
      "a rapid abstract, which may be supported by a _general_ appeal to the\n",
      "order and text of the original historians. In this introduction, I\n",
      "shall confine myself to the revolutions of the throne, the succession\n",
      "of families, the personal characters of the Greek princes, the mode\n",
      "of their life and death, the maxims and influence of their domestic\n",
      "government, and the tendency of their reign to accelerate or suspend the\n",
      "downfall of the Eastern empire. Such a chronological review will serve\n",
      "to illustrate the various argument of the subsequent chapters; and each\n",
      "circumstance of the eventful story of the Barbarians will adapt itself\n",
      "in a proper place to the Byzantine annals. The internal state of the\n",
      "empire, and the dangerous heresy of the Paulicians, which shook the East\n",
      "and enlightened the West, will be the subject of two separate chapters;\n",
      "but these inquiries must be postponed till our further progress shall\n",
      "have opened the view of the world in the ninth and tenth centuries of\n",
      "the Christian area. After this foundation of Byzantine history, the\n",
      "following nations will pass before our eyes, and each will occupy the\n",
      "space to which it may be entitled by greatness or merit, or the degree\n",
      "of connection with the Roman world and the present age. I. The Franks; a\n",
      "general appellation which includes all the Barbarians of France, Italy,\n",
      "and Germany, who were united by the sword and sceptre of Charlemagne.\n",
      "The persecution of images and their votaries separated Rome and Italy\n",
      "from the Byzantine throne, and prepared the restoration of the Roman\n",
      "empire in the West. II. The Arabs or Saracens. Three ample chapters will\n",
      "be devoted to this curious and interesting object. In the first, after\n",
      "a picture of the country and its inhabitants, I shall investigate\n",
      "the character of Mahomet; the character, religion, and success of the\n",
      "prophet. In the second, I shall lead the Arabs to the conquest of Syria,\n",
      "Egypt, and Africa, the provinces of the Roman empire; nor can I check\n",
      "their victorious career till they have overthrown the monarchies of\n",
      "Persia and Spain. In the third, I shall inquire how Constantinople and\n",
      "Europe were saved by the luxury and arts, the division and decay, of\n",
      "the empire of the caliphs. A single chapter will include, III. The\n",
      "Bulgarians, IV. Hungarians, and, V. Russians, who assaulted by sea or by\n",
      "land the provinces and the capital; but the last of these, so important\n",
      "in their present greatness, will excite some curiosity in their origin\n",
      "and infancy. VI. The Normans; or rather the private adventurers of that\n",
      "warlike people, who founded a powerful kingdom in Apulia and Sicily,\n",
      "shook the throne of Constantinople, displayed the trophies of chivalry,\n",
      "and almost realized the wonders of romance. VII. The Latins; the\n",
      "subjects of the pope, the nations of the West, who enlisted under the\n",
      "banner of the cross for the recovery or relief of the holy sepulchre.\n",
      "The Greek emperors were terrified and preserved by the myriads of\n",
      "pilgrims who marched to Jerusalem with Godfrey of Bouillon and the peers\n",
      "of Christendom. The second and third crusades trod in the footsteps of\n",
      "the first: Asia and Europe were mingled in a sacred war of two hundred\n",
      "years; and the Christian powers were bravely resisted, and finally\n",
      "expelled by Saladin and the Mamelukes of Egypt. In these memorable\n",
      "crusades, a fleet and army of French and Venetians were diverted from\n",
      "Syria to the Thracian Bosphorus: they assaulted the capital, they\n",
      "subverted the Greek monarchy: and a dynasty of Latin princes was seated\n",
      "near threescore years on the throne of Constantine. VIII. The Greeks\n",
      "themselves, during this period of captivity and exile, must be\n",
      "considered as a foreign nation; the enemies, and again the sovereigns of\n",
      "Constantinople. Misfortune had rekindled a spark of national virtue;\n",
      "and the Imperial series may be continued with some dignity from their\n",
      "restoration to the Turkish conquest. IX. The Moguls and Tartars. By the\n",
      "arms of Zingis and his descendants, the globe was shaken from China to\n",
      "Poland and Greece: the sultans were overthrown: the caliphs fell, and\n",
      "the CÊsars trembled on their throne. The victories of Timour suspended\n",
      "above fifty years the final ruin of the Byzantine empire. X. I have\n",
      "already noticed the first appearance of the Turks; and the names of\n",
      "the fathers, of _Seljuk_ and _Othman_, discriminate the two successive\n",
      "dynasties of the nation, which emerged in the eleventh century from\n",
      "the Scythian wilderness. The former established a splendid and potent\n",
      "kingdom from the banks of the Oxus to Antioch and Nice; and the first\n",
      "crusade was provoked by the violation of Jerusalem and the danger of\n",
      "Constantinople. From an humble origin, the _Ottomans_ arose, the scourge\n",
      "and terror of Christendom. Constantinople was besieged and taken by\n",
      "Mahomet II., and his triumph annihilates the remnant, the image, the\n",
      "title, of the Roman empire in the East. The schism of the Greeks will be\n",
      "connected with their last calamities, and the restoration of learning in\n",
      "the Western world. I shall return from the captivity of the new, to the\n",
      "ruins of ancient Rome; and the venerable name, the interesting theme,\n",
      "will shed a ray of glory on the conclusion of my labors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The emperor Heraclius had punished a tyrant and ascended his throne; and\n",
      "the memory of his reign is perpetuated by the transient conquest, and\n",
      "irreparable loss, of the Eastern provinces. After the death of Eudocia,\n",
      "his first wife, he disobeyed the patriarch, and violated the laws, by\n",
      "his second marriage with his niece Martina; and the superstition of the\n",
      "Greeks beheld the judgment of Heaven in the diseases of the father and\n",
      "the deformity of his offspring. But the opinion of an illegitimate birth\n",
      "is sufficient to distract the choice, and loosen the obedience, of the\n",
      "people: the ambition of Martina was quickened by maternal love, and\n",
      "perhaps by the envy of a step-mother; and the aged husband was too\n",
      "feeble to withstand the arts of conjugal allurements. Constantine,\n",
      "his eldest son, enjoyed in a mature age the title of Augustus; but the\n",
      "weakness of his constitution required a colleague and a guardian, and\n",
      "he yielded with secret reluctance to the partition of the empire. The\n",
      "senate was summoned to the palace to ratify or attest the association\n",
      "of Heracleonas, the son of Martina: the imposition of the diadem was\n",
      "consecrated by the prayer and blessing of the patriarch; the senators\n",
      "and patricians adored the majesty of the great emperor and the partners\n",
      "of his reign; and as soon as the doors were thrown open, they were\n",
      "hailed by the tumultuary but important voice of the soldiers. After an\n",
      "interval of five months, the pompous ceremonies which formed the\n",
      "essence of the Byzantine state were celebrated in the cathedral and the\n",
      "hippodrome; the concord of the royal brothers was affectedly displayed\n",
      "by the younger leaning on the arm of the elder; and the name of Martina\n",
      "was mingled in the reluctant or venal acclamations of the people.\n",
      "Heraclius survived this association about two years: his last testimony\n",
      "declared his two sons the equal heirs of the Eastern empire, and\n",
      "commanded them to honor his widow Martina as their mother and their\n",
      "sovereign.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Martina first appeared on the throne with the name and attributes\n",
      "of royalty, she was checked by a firm, though respectful, opposition;\n",
      "and the dying embers of freedom were kindled by the breath of\n",
      "superstitious prejudice. \"We reverence,\" exclaimed the voice of a\n",
      "citizen, \"we reverence the mother of our princes; but to those princes\n",
      "alone our obedience is due; and Constantine, the elder emperor, is of an\n",
      "age to sustain, in his own hands, the weight of the sceptre. Your sex is\n",
      "excluded by nature from the toils of government. How could you combat,\n",
      "how could you answer, the Barbarians, who, with hostile or friendly\n",
      "intentions, may approach the royal city? May Heaven avert from the Roman\n",
      "republic this national disgrace, which would provoke the patience of the\n",
      "slaves of Persia!\" Martina descended from the throne with indignation,\n",
      "and sought a refuge in the female apartment of the palace. The reign of\n",
      "Constantine the Third lasted only one hundred and three days: he expired\n",
      "in the thirtieth year of his age, and, although his life had been a long\n",
      "malady, a belief was entertained that poison had been the means, and\n",
      "his cruel step-mother the author, of his untimely fate. Martina reaped\n",
      "indeed the harvest of his death, and assumed the government in the name\n",
      "of the surviving emperor; but the incestuous widow of Heraclius was\n",
      "universally abhorred; the jealousy of the people was awakened, and the\n",
      "two orphans whom Constantine had left became the objects of the public\n",
      "care. It was in vain that the son of Martina, who was no more than\n",
      "fifteen years of age, was taught to declare himself the guardian of his\n",
      "nephews, one of whom he had presented at the baptismal font: it was in\n",
      "vain that he swore on the wood of the true cross, to defend them against\n",
      "all their enemies. On his death-bed, the late emperor had despatched\n",
      "a trusty servant to arm the troops and provinces of the East in the\n",
      "defence of his helpless children: the eloquence and liberality of\n",
      "Valentin had been successful, and from his camp of Chalcedon, he boldly\n",
      "demanded the punishment of the assassins, and the restoration of the\n",
      "lawful heir. The license of the soldiers, who devoured the grapes and\n",
      "drank the wine of their Asiatic vineyards, provoked the citizens of\n",
      "Constantinople against the domestic authors of their calamities, and the\n",
      "dome of St. Sophia reÎchoed, not with prayers and hymns, but with the\n",
      "clamors and imprecations of an enraged multitude. At their imperious\n",
      "command, Heracleonas appeared in the pulpit with the eldest of the royal\n",
      "orphans; Constans alone was saluted as emperor of the Romans, and a\n",
      "crown of gold, which had been taken from the tomb of Heraclius, was\n",
      "placed on his head, with the solemn benediction of the patriarch. But\n",
      "in the tumult of joy and indignation, the church was pillaged, the\n",
      "sanctuary was polluted by a promiscuous crowd of Jews and Barbarians;\n",
      "and the Monothelite Pyrrhus, a creature of the empress, after dropping a\n",
      "protestation on the altar, escaped by a prudent flight from the zeal\n",
      "of the Catholics. A more serious and bloody task was reserved for\n",
      "the senate, who derived a temporary strength from the consent of the\n",
      "soldiers and people. The spirit of Roman freedom revived the ancient\n",
      "and awful examples of the judgment of tyrants, and the Imperial culprits\n",
      "were deposed and condemned as the authors of the death of Constantine.\n",
      "But the severity of the conscript fathers was stained by the\n",
      "indiscriminate punishment of the innocent and the guilty: Martina and\n",
      "Heracleonas were sentenced to the amputation, the former of her tongue,\n",
      "the latter of his nose; and after this cruel execution, they consumed\n",
      "the remainder of their days in exile and oblivion. The Greeks who were\n",
      "capable of reflection might find some consolation for their servitude,\n",
      "by observing the abuse of power when it was lodged for a moment in the\n",
      "hands of an aristocracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shall imagine ourselves transported five hundred years backwards to\n",
      "the age of the Antonines, if we listen to the oration which Constans II.\n",
      "pronounced in the twelfth year of his age before the Byzantine senate.\n",
      "After returning his thanks for the just punishment of the assassins, who\n",
      "had intercepted the fairest hopes of his father's reign, \"By the divine\n",
      "Providence,\" said the young emperor, \"and by your righteous decree,\n",
      "Martina and her incestuous progeny have been cast headlong from the\n",
      "throne. Your majesty and wisdom have prevented the Roman state from\n",
      "degenerating into lawless tyranny. I therefore exhort and beseech you\n",
      "to stand forth as the counsellors and judges of the common safety.\" The\n",
      "senators were gratified by the respectful address and liberal donative\n",
      "of their sovereign; but these servile Greeks were unworthy and\n",
      "regardless of freedom; and in his mind, the lesson of an hour was\n",
      "quickly erased by the prejudices of the age and the habits of despotism.\n",
      "He retained only a jealous fear lest the senate or people should one day\n",
      "invade the right of primogeniture, and seat his brother Theodosius on\n",
      "an equal throne. By the imposition of holy orders, the grandson of\n",
      "Heraclius was disqualified for the purple; but this ceremony, which\n",
      "seemed to profane the sacraments of the church, was insufficient to\n",
      "appease the suspicions of the tyrant, and the death of the deacon\n",
      "Theodosius could alone expiate the crime of his royal birth. His\n",
      "murder was avenged by the imprecations of the people, and the assassin,\n",
      "in the fullness of power, was driven from his capital into voluntary\n",
      "and perpetual exile. Constans embarked for Greece and, as if he meant\n",
      "to retort the abhorrence which he deserved he is said, from the Imperial\n",
      "galley, to have spit against the walls of his native city. After passing\n",
      "the winter at Athens, he sailed to Tarentum in Italy, visited Rome,\n",
      "and concluded a long pilgrimage of disgrace and sacrilegious rapine,\n",
      "by fixing his residence at Syracuse. But if Constans could fly from his\n",
      "people, he could not fly from himself. The remorse of his conscience\n",
      "created a phantom who pursued him by land and sea, by day and by night;\n",
      "and the visionary Theodosius, presenting to his lips a cup of blood,\n",
      "said, or seemed to say, \"Drink, brother, drink;\" a sure emblem of the\n",
      "aggravation of his guilt, since he had received from the hands of the\n",
      "deacon the mystic cup of the blood of Christ. Odious to himself and to\n",
      "mankind, Constans perished by domestic, perhaps by episcopal, treason,\n",
      "in the capital of Sicily. A servant who waited in the bath, after\n",
      "pouring warm water on his head, struck him violently with the vase.\n",
      "He fell, stunned by the blow, and suffocated by the water; and his\n",
      "attendants, who wondered at the tedious delay, beheld with indifference\n",
      "the corpse of their lifeless emperor. The troops of Sicily invested\n",
      "with the purple an obscure youth, whose inimitable beauty eluded, and it\n",
      "might easily elude, the declining art of the painters and sculptors of\n",
      "the age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Constans had left in the Byzantine palace three sons, the eldest of\n",
      "whom had been clothed in his infancy with the purple. When the father\n",
      "summoned them to attend his person in Sicily, these precious hostages\n",
      "were detained by the Greeks, and a firm refusal informed him that they\n",
      "were the children of the state. The news of his murder was conveyed\n",
      "with almost supernatural speed from Syracuse to Constantinople; and\n",
      "Constantine, the eldest of his sons, inherited his throne without being\n",
      "the heir of the public hatred. His subjects contributed, with zeal and\n",
      "alacrity, to chastise the guilt and presumption of a province which had\n",
      "usurped the rights of the senate and people; the young emperor sailed\n",
      "from the Hellespont with a powerful fleet; and the legions of Rome and\n",
      "Carthage were assembled under his standard in the harbor of Syracuse.\n",
      "The defeat of the Sicilian tyrant was easy, his punishment just, and his\n",
      "beauteous head was exposed in the hippodrome: but I cannot applaud the\n",
      "clemency of a prince, who, among a crowd of victims, condemned the son\n",
      "of a patrician, for deploring with some bitterness the execution of a\n",
      "virtuous father. The youth was castrated: he survived the operation,\n",
      "and the memory of this indecent cruelty is preserved by the elevation of\n",
      "Germanus to the rank of a patriarch and saint. After pouring this bloody\n",
      "libation on his father's tomb, Constantine returned to his capital; and\n",
      "the growth of his young beard during the Sicilian voyage was announced,\n",
      "by the familiar surname of Pogonatus, to the Grecian world. But his\n",
      "reign, like that of his predecessor, was stained with fraternal discord.\n",
      "On his two brothers, Heraclius and Tiberius, he had bestowed the title\n",
      "of Augustus; an empty title, for they continued to languish, without\n",
      "trust or power, in the solitude of the palace. At their secret\n",
      "instigation, the troops of the Anatolian _theme_ or province approached\n",
      "the city on the Asiatic side, demanded for the royal brothers the\n",
      "partition or exercise of sovereignty, and supported their seditious\n",
      "claim by a theological argument. They were Christians, (they cried,)\n",
      "and orthodox Catholics; the sincere votaries of the holy and undivided\n",
      "Trinity. Since there are three equal persons in heaven, it is reasonable\n",
      "there should be three equal persons upon earth. The emperor invited\n",
      "these learned divines to a friendly conference, in which they might\n",
      "propose their arguments to the senate: they obeyed the summons, but the\n",
      "prospect of their bodies hanging on the gibbet in the suburb of Galata\n",
      "reconciled their companions to the unity of the reign of Constantine.\n",
      "He pardoned his brothers, and their names were still pronounced in the\n",
      "public acclamations: but on the repetition or suspicion of a similar\n",
      "offence, the obnoxious princes were deprived of their titles and\n",
      "noses, in the presence of the Catholic bishops who were assembled at\n",

      "the bloody execution was intrusted to his favorite Stephen, who was\n",
      "recommended by the epithet of the savage. Yet even the savage Stephen\n",
      "imperfectly accomplished the intentions of his sovereign. The slowness\n",

      "behind him an ample treasure, the fruit of cruelty and rapine: but\n",

      "the restless impatience of Anastasius tempted him to risk and to lose\n",

      "Third supported himself against the envy of his equals, the discontent\n",

      "enemies. The Catholics, who accuse his religious innovations, are\n",
      "obliged to confess that they were undertaken with temper and conducted\n",
      "with firmness. Their silence respects the wisdom of his administration\n",
      "and the purity of his manners. After a reign of twenty-four years, he\n",
      "peaceably expired in the palace of Constantinople; and the purple which\n",

      "Constantine the Fifth, surnamed Copronymus, attacked with less temperate\n",
      "zeal the images or idols of the church. Their votaries have exhausted\n",
      "the bitterness of religious gall, in their portrait of this spotted\n",
      "panther, this antichrist, this flying dragon of the serpent's seed,\n",
      "who surpassed the vices of Elagabalus and Nero. His reign was a long\n",
      "butchery of whatever was most noble, or holy, or innocent, in his\n",
      "empire. In person, the emperor assisted at the execution of his victims,\n",
      "surveyed their agonies, listened to their groans, and indulged, without\n",
      "satiating, his appetite for blood: a plate of noses was accepted as a\n",
      "grateful offering, and his domestics were often scourged or mutilated\n",
      "by the royal hand. His surname was derived from his pollution of his\n",
      "baptismal font. The infant might be excused; but the manly pleasures of\n",
      "Copronymus degraded him below the level of a brute; his lust confounded\n",
      "the eternal distinctions of sex and species, and he seemed to extract\n",
      "some unnatural delight from the objects most offensive to human sense.\n",
      "In his religion the Iconoclast was a Heretic, a Jew, a Mahometan, a\n",
      "Pagan, and an Atheist; and his belief of an invisible power could\n",
      "be discovered only in his magic rites, human victims, and nocturnal\n",
      "sacrifices to Venus and the dÊmons of antiquity. His life was stained\n",
      "with the most opposite vices, and the ulcers which covered his body,\n",
      "anticipated before his death the sentiment of hell-tortures. Of these\n",
      "accusations, which I have so patiently copied, a part is refuted by its\n",
      "own absurdity; and in the private anecdotes of the life of the princes,\n",
      "the lie is more easy as the detection is more difficult. Without\n",
      "adopting the pernicious maxim, that where much is alleged, something\n",
      "must be true, I can however discern, that Constantine the Fifth was\n",
      "dissolute and cruel. Calumny is more prone to exaggerate than to invent;\n",
      "and her licentious tongue is checked in some measure by the experience\n",
      "of the age and country to which she appeals. Of the bishops and monks,\n",
      "the generals and magistrates, who are said to have suffered under\n",
      "his reign, the numbers are recorded, the names were conspicuous, the\n",
      "execution was public, the mutilation visible and permanent. The\n",
      "Catholics hated the person and government of Copronymus; but even their\n",
      "hatred is a proof of their oppression. They dissembled the provocations\n",
      "which might excuse or justify his rigor, but even these provocations\n",
      "must gradually inflame his resentment and harden his temper in the use\n",
      "or the abuse of despotism. Yet the character of the fifth Constantine\n",
      "was not devoid of merit, nor did his government always deserve the\n",
      "curses or the contempt of the Greeks. From the confession of his\n",
      "enemies, I am informed of the restoration of an ancient aqueduct, of the\n",
      "redemption of two thousand five hundred captives, of the uncommon\n",
      "plenty of the times, and of the new colonies with which he repeopled\n",
      "Constantinople and the Thracian cities. They reluctantly praise his\n",
      "activity and courage; he was on horseback in the field at the head\n",
      "of his legions; and, although the fortune of his arms was various, he\n",
      "triumphed by sea and land, on the Euphrates and the Danube, in civil\n",
      "and Barbarian war. Heretical praise must be cast into the scale to\n",
      "counterbalance the weight of orthodox invective. The Iconoclasts revered\n",
      "the virtues of the prince: forty years after his death they still prayed\n",
      "before the tomb of the saint. A miraculous vision was propagated by\n",
      "fanaticism or fraud: and the Christian hero appeared on a milk-white\n",
      "steed, brandishing his lance against the Pagans of Bulgaria: \"An absurd\n",
      "fable,\" says the Catholic historian, \"since Copronymus is chained with\n",
      "the dÊmons in the abyss of hell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo the Fourth, the son of the fifth and the father of the sixth\n",
      "Constantine, was of a feeble constitution both of mind and body, and\n",
      "the principal care of his reign was the settlement of the succession.\n",
      "The association of the young Constantine was urged by the officious\n",
      "zeal of his subjects; and the emperor, conscious of his decay, complied,\n",
      "after a prudent hesitation, with their unanimous wishes. The royal\n",
      "infant, at the age of five years, was crowned with his mother Irene;\n",
      "and the national consent was ratified by every circumstance of pomp\n",
      "and solemnity, that could dazzle the eyes or bind the conscience of the\n",

      "the throne; the injustice of their elder brother defrauded them of a\n",
      "legacy of about two millions sterling; some vain titles were not deemed\n",
      "a sufficient compensation for wealth and power; and they repeatedly\n",
      "conspired against their nephew, before and after the death of his\n",
      "father. Their first attempt was pardoned; for the second offence they\n",
      "were condemned to the ecclesiastical state; and for the third treason,\n",
      "Nicephorus, the eldest and most guilty, was deprived of his eyes, and\n",

      "punished, as a milder sentence, by the amputation of their tongues.\n",
      "After five years' confinement, they escaped to the church of St. Sophia,\n",

      "soothed the unhappy princes with flattery and hope, and gently drew\n",
      "them from the sanctuary to the palace. They were speedily embarked for\n",
      "Greece, and Athens was allotted for the place of their exile. In this\n",
      "calm retreat, and in their helpless condition, Nicephorus and his\n",

      "Sclavonian chief, who offered to break their prison, and to lead them\n",
      "in arms, and in the purple, to the gates of Constantinople. But the\n",
      "Athenian people, ever zealous in the cause of Irene, prevented her\n",
      "justice or cruelty; and the five sons of Copronymus were plunged in\n",
      "eternal darkness and oblivion.\n",
      "\n",
      "For himself, that emperor had chosen a Barbarian wife, the daughter of\n",
      "the khan of the Chozars; but in the marriage of his heir, he preferred\n",
      "an Athenian virgin, an orphan, seventeen years old, whose sole fortune\n",
      "must have consisted in her personal accomplishments. The nuptials of Leo\n",
      "and Irene were celebrated with royal pomp; she soon acquired the love\n",
      "and confidence of a feeble husband, and in his testament he declared the\n",
      "empress guardian of the Roman world, and of their son Constantine the\n",
      "Sixth, who was no more than ten years of age. During his childhood,\n",
      "Irene most ably and assiduously discharged, in her public\n",
      "administration, the duties of a faithful mother; and her zeal in the\n",
      "restoration of images has deserved the name and honors of a saint, which\n",
      "she still occupies in the Greek calendar. But the emperor attained\n",
      "the maturity of youth; the maternal yoke became more grievous; and he\n",
      "listened to the favorites of his own age, who shared his pleasures, and\n",
      "were ambitious of sharing his power. Their reasons convinced him of\n",
      "his right, their praises of his ability, to reign; and he consented to\n",
      "reward the services of Irene by a perpetual banishment to the Isle of\n",
      "Sicily. But her vigilance and penetration easily disconcerted their\n",
      "rash projects: a similar, or more severe, punishment was retaliated on\n",
      "themselves and their advisers; and Irene inflicted on the ungrateful\n",
      "prince the chastisement of a boy. After this contest, the mother and\n",
      "the son were at the head of two domestic factions; and instead of mild\n",
      "influence and voluntary obedience, she held in chains a captive and an\n",
      "enemy. The empress was overthrown by the abuse of victory; the oath\n",
      "of fidelity, which she exacted to herself alone, was pronounced\n",
      "with reluctant murmurs; and the bold refusal of the Armenian guards\n",
      "encouraged a free and general declaration, that Constantine the Sixth\n",
      "was the lawful emperor of the Romans. In this character he ascended his\n",
      "hereditary throne, and dismissed Irene to a life of solitude and repose.\n",
      "But her haughty spirit condescended to the arts of dissimulation: she\n",
      "flattered the bishops and eunuchs, revived the filial tenderness of\n",
      "the prince, regained his confidence, and betrayed his credulity. The\n",
      "character of Constantine was not destitute of sense or spirit; but\n",
      "his education had been studiously neglected; and the ambitious mother\n",
      "exposed to the public censure the vices which she had nourished, and the\n",
      "actions which she had secretly advised: his divorce and second marriage\n",
      "offended the prejudices of the clergy, and by his imprudent rigor he\n",
      "forfeited the attachment of the Armenian guards. A powerful conspiracy\n",
      "was formed for the restoration of Irene; and the secret, though widely\n",
      "diffused, was faithfully kept above eight months, till the emperor,\n",
      "suspicious of his danger, escaped from Constantinople, with the design\n",
      "of appealing to the provinces and armies. By this hasty flight, the\n",
      "empress was left on the brink of the precipice; yet before she implored\n",
      "the mercy of her son, Irene addressed a private epistle to the friends\n",
      "whom she had placed about his person, with a menace, that unless _they_\n",
      "accomplished, _she_ would reveal, their treason. Their fear rendered\n",
      "them intrepid; they seized the emperor on the Asiatic shore, and he was\n",
      "transported to the porphyry apartment of the palace, where he had\n",
      "first seen the light. In the mind of Irene, ambition had stifled every\n",
      "sentiment of humanity and nature; and it was decreed in her bloody\n",
      "council, that Constantine should be rendered incapable of the throne:\n",
      "her emissaries assaulted the sleeping prince, and stabbed their daggers\n",
      "with such violence and precipitation into his eyes as if they meant to\n",
      "execute a mortal sentence. An ambiguous passage of Theophanes persuaded\n",
      "the annalist of the church that death was the immediate consequence of\n",
      "this barbarous execution. The Catholics have been deceived or subdued by\n",
      "the authority of Baronius; and Protestant zeal has reÎchoed the words\n",
      "of a cardinal, desirous, as it should seem, to favor the patroness of\n",
      "images. Yet the blind son of Irene survived many years, oppressed by\n",
      "the court and forgotten by the world; the Isaurian dynasty was silently\n",
      "extinguished; and the memory of Constantine was recalled only by the\n",
      "nuptials of his daughter Euphrosyne with the emperor Michael the Second.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most bigoted orthodoxy has justly execrated the unnatural mother,\n",
      "who may not easily be paralleled in the history of crimes. To her bloody\n",
      "deed superstition has attributed a subsequent darkness of seventeen\n",
      "days; during which many vessels in midday were driven from their course,\n",
      "as if the sun, a globe of fire so vast and so remote, could sympathize\n",
      "with the atoms of a revolving planet. On earth, the crime of Irene\n",
      "was left five years unpunished; her reign was crowned with external\n",
      "splendor; and if she could silence the voice of conscience, she neither\n",
      "heard nor regarded the reproaches of mankind. The Roman world bowed\n",
      "to the government of a female; and as she moved through the streets of\n",
      "Constantinople, the reins of four milk-white steeds were held by as\n",
      "many patricians, who marched on foot before the golden chariot of their\n",
      "queen. But these patricians were for the most part eunuchs; and their\n",
      "black ingratitude justified, on this occasion, the popular hatred and\n",
      "contempt. Raised, enriched, intrusted with the first dignities of the\n",
      "empire, they basely conspired against their benefactress; the great\n",
      "treasurer Nicephorus was secretly invested with the purple; her\n",
      "successor was introduced into the palace, and crowned at St. Sophia by\n",
      "the venal patriarch. In their first interview, she recapitulated with\n",
      "dignity the revolutions of her life, gently accused the perfidy of\n",
      "Nicephorus, insinuated that he owed his life to her unsuspicious\n",
      "clemency, and for the throne and treasures which she resigned, solicited\n",
      "a decent and honorable retreat. His avarice refused this modest\n",
      "compensation; and, in her exile of the Isle of Lesbos, the empress\n",
      "earned a scanty subsistence by the labors of her distaff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many tyrants have reigned undoubtedly more criminal than Nicephorus, but\n",
      "none perhaps have more deeply incurred the universal abhorrence of\n",
      "their people. His character was stained with the three odious vices of\n",
      "hypocrisy, ingratitude, and avarice: his want of virtue was not redeemed\n",
      "by any superior talents, nor his want of talents by any pleasing\n",
      "qualifications. Unskilful and unfortunate in war, Nicephorus was\n",
      "vanquished by the Saracens, and slain by the Bulgarians; and the\n",
      "advantage of his death overbalanced, in the public opinion, the\n",
      "destruction of a Roman army. His son and heir Stauracius escaped from\n",
      "the field with a mortal wound; yet six months of an expiring life were\n",
      "sufficient to refute his indecent, though popular declaration, that\n",
      "he would in all things avoid the example of his father. On the near\n",
      "prospect of his decease, Michael, the great master of the palace, and\n",
      "the husband of his sister Procopia, was named by every person of the\n",
      "palace and city, except by his envious brother. Tenacious of a sceptre\n",
      "now falling from his hand, he conspired against the life of his\n",
      "successor, and cherished the idea of changing to a democracy the Roman\n",
      "empire. But these rash projects served only to inflame the zeal of the\n",
      "people and to remove the scruples of the candidate: Michael the First\n",
      "accepted the purple, and before he sunk into the grave the son of\n",
      "Nicephorus implored the clemency of his new sovereign. Had Michael in\n",
      "an age of peace ascended an hereditary throne, he might have reigned and\n",
      "died the father of his people: but his mild virtues were adapted to the\n",
      "shade of private life, nor was he capable of controlling the ambition of\n",
      "his equals, or of resisting the arms of the victorious Bulgarians.\n",
      "While his want of ability and success exposed him to the contempt of\n",
      "the soldiers, the masculine spirit of his wife Procopia awakened their\n",
      "indignation. Even the Greeks of the ninth century were provoked by the\n",
      "insolence of a female, who, in the front of the standards, presumed to\n",
      "direct their discipline and animate their valor; and their licentious\n",
      "clamors advised the new Semiramis to reverence the majesty of a Roman\n",
      "camp. After an unsuccessful campaign, the emperor left, in their\n",
      "winter-quarters of Thrace, a disaffected army under the command of his\n",
      "enemies; and their artful eloquence persuaded the soldiers to break\n",
      "the dominion of the eunuchs, to degrade the husband of Procopia, and\n",
      "to assert the right of a military election. They marched towards the\n",
      "capital: yet the clergy, the senate, and the people of Constantinople,\n",
      "adhered to the cause of Michael; and the troops and treasures of Asia\n",
      "might have protracted the mischiefs of civil war. But his humanity (by\n",
      "the ambitious it will be termed his weakness) protested that not a drop\n",
      "of Christian blood should be shed in his quarrel, and his messengers\n",
      "presented the conquerors with the keys of the city and the palace. They\n",
      "were disarmed by his innocence and submission; his life and his eyes\n",
      "were spared; and the Imperial monk enjoyed the comforts of solitude and\n",
      "religion above thirty-two years after he had been stripped of the purple\n",
      "and separated from his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "A rebel, in the time of Nicephorus, the famous and unfortunate Bardanes,\n",
      "had once the curiosity to consult an Asiatic prophet, who, after\n",
      "prognosticating his fall, announced the fortunes of his three principal\n",
      "officers, Leo the Armenian, Michael the Phrygian, and Thomas the\n",
      "Cappadocian, the successive reigns of the two former, the fruitless and\n",
      "fatal enterprise of the third. This prediction was verified, or rather\n",
      "was produced, by the event. Ten years afterwards, when the Thracian camp\n",
      "rejected the husband of Procopia, the crown was presented to the same\n",
      "Leo, the first in military rank and the secret author of the mutiny. As\n",
      "he affected to hesitate, \"With this sword,\" said his companion Michael,\n",
      "\"I will open the gates of Constantinople to your Imperial sway; or\n",
      "instantly plunge it into your bosom, if you obstinately resist the just\n",
      "desires of your fellow-soldiers.\" The compliance of the Armenian was\n",
      "rewarded with the empire, and he reigned seven years and a half under\n",
      "the name of Leo the Fifth. Educated in a camp, and ignorant both of laws\n",
      "and letters, he introduced into his civil government the rigor and\n",
      "even cruelty of military discipline; but if his severity was sometimes\n",
      "dangerous to the innocent, it was always formidable to the guilty. His\n",
      "religious inconstancy was taxed by the epithet of Chameleon, but the\n",
      "Catholics have acknowledged by the voice of a saint and confessors, that\n",
      "the life of the Iconoclast was useful to the republic. The zeal of his\n",
      "companion Michael was repaid with riches, honors, and military command;\n",
      "and his subordinate talents were beneficially employed in the public\n",
      "service. Yet the Phrygian was dissatisfied at receiving as a favor a\n",
      "scanty portion of the Imperial prize which he had bestowed on his equal;\n",
      "and his discontent, which sometimes evaporated in hasty discourse, at\n",
      "length assumed a more threatening and hostile aspect against a prince\n",
      "whom he represented as a cruel tyrant. That tyrant, however, repeatedly\n",
      "detected, warned, and dismissed the old companion of his arms, till fear\n",
      "and resentment prevailed over gratitude; and Michael, after a scrutiny\n",
      "into his actions and designs, was convicted of treason, and sentenced to\n",
      "be burnt alive in the furnace of the private baths. The devout humanity\n",
      "of the empress Theophano was fatal to her husband and family. A solemn\n",
      "day, the twenty-fifth of December, had been fixed for the execution: she\n",
      "urged, that the anniversary of the Savior's birth would be profaned by\n",
      "this inhuman spectacle, and Leo consented with reluctance to a decent\n",
      "respite. But on the vigil of the feast his sleepless anxiety prompted\n",
      "him to visit at the dead of night the chamber in which his enemy was\n",
      "confined: he beheld him released from his chain, and stretched on his\n",
      "jailer's bed in a profound slumber. Leo was alarmed at these signs of\n",
      "security and intelligence; but though he retired with silent steps, his\n",
      "entrance and departure were noticed by a slave who lay concealed in a\n",
      "corner of the prison. Under the pretence of requesting the spiritual\n",
      "aid of a confessor, Michael informed the conspirators, that their lives\n",
      "depended on his discretion, and that a few hours were left to assure\n",
      "their own safety, by the deliverance of their friend and country. On the\n",
      "great festivals, a chosen band of priests and chanters was admitted into\n",
      "the palace by a private gate to sing matins in the chapel; and Leo, who\n",
      "regulated with the same strictness the discipline of the choir and\n",
      "of the camp, was seldom absent from these early devotions. In the\n",
      "ecclesiastical habit, but with their swords under their robes, the\n",
      "conspirators mingled with the procession, lurked in the angles of the\n",
      "chapel, and expected, as the signal of murder, the intonation of\n",
      "the first psalm by the emperor himself. The imperfect light, and the\n",
      "uniformity of dress, might have favored his escape, whilst their assault\n",
      "was pointed against a harmless priest; but they soon discovered their\n",
      "mistake, and encompassed on all sides the royal victim. Without a weapon\n",
      "and without a friend, he grasped a weighty cross, and stood at bay\n",
      "against the hunters of his life; but as he asked for mercy, \"This is\n",
      "the hour, not of mercy, but of vengeance,\" was the inexorable reply. The\n",
      "stroke of a well-aimed sword separated from his body the right arm and\n",
      "the cross, and Leo the Armenian was slain at the foot of the altar.\n",
      "\n",
      "A memorable reverse of fortune was displayed in Michael the Second, who\n",
      "from a defect in his speech was surnamed the Stammerer. He was snatched\n",
      "from the fiery furnace to the sovereignty of an empire; and as in the\n",
      "tumult a smith could not readily be found, the fetters remained on his\n",
      "legs several hours after he was seated on the throne of the CÊsars. The\n",
      "royal blood which had been the price of his elevation, was unprofitably\n",
      "spent: in the purple he retained the ignoble vices of his origin; and\n",
      "Michael lost his provinces with as supine indifference as if they had\n",
      "been the inheritance of his fathers. His title was disputed by Thomas,\n",
      "the last of the military triumvirate, who transported into Europe\n",
      "fourscore thousand Barbarians from the banks of the Tigris and the\n",
      "shores of the Caspian. He formed the siege of Constantinople; but the\n",
      "capital was defended with spiritual and carnal weapons; a Bulgarian king\n",
      "assaulted the camp of the Orientals, and Thomas had the misfortune, or\n",
      "the weakness, to fall alive into the power of the conqueror. The hands\n",
      "and feet of the rebel were amputated; he was placed on an ass, and,\n",
      "amidst the insults of the people, was led through the streets, which he\n",
      "sprinkled with his blood. The depravation of manners, as savage as they\n",
      "were corrupt, is marked by the presence of the emperor himself. Deaf\n",
      "to the lamentation of a fellow-soldier, he incessantly pressed the\n",
      "discovery of more accomplices, till his curiosity was checked by the\n",
      "question of an honest or guilty minister: \"Would you give credit to an\n",
      "enemy against the most faithful of your friends?\" After the death of\n",
      "his first wife, the emperor, at the request of the senate, drew from her\n",
      "monastery Euphrosyne, the daughter of Constantine the Sixth. Her august\n",
      "birth might justify a stipulation in the marriage-contract, that her\n",
      "children should equally share the empire with their elder brother. But\n",
      "the nuptials of Michael and Euphrosyne were barren; and she was content\n",
      "with the title of mother of Theophilus, his son and successor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The character of Theophilus is a rare example in which religious zeal\n",
      "has allowed, and perhaps magnified, the virtues of a heretic and a\n",
      "persecutor. His valor was often felt by the enemies, and his justice by\n",
      "the subjects, of the monarchy; but the valor of Theophilus was rash and\n",
      "fruitless, and his justice arbitrary and cruel. He displayed the\n",
      "banner of the cross against the Saracens; but his five expeditions\n",
      "were concluded by a signal overthrow: Amorium, the native city of his\n",
      "ancestors, was levelled with the ground and from his military toils he\n",
      "derived only the surname of the Unfortunate. The wisdom of a sovereign\n",
      "is comprised in the institution of laws and the choice of magistrates,\n",
      "and while he seems without action, his civil government revolves round\n",
      "his centre with the silence and order of the planetary system. But\n",
      "the justice of Theophilus was fashioned on the model of the Oriental\n",
      "despots, who, in personal and irregular acts of authority, consult the\n",
      "reason or passion of the moment, without measuring the sentence by the\n",
      "law, or the penalty by the offense. A poor woman threw herself at the\n",
      "emperor's feet to complain of a powerful neighbor, the brother of the\n",
      "empress, who had raised his palace-wall to such an inconvenient height,\n",
      "that her humble dwelling was excluded from light and air! On the proof\n",
      "of the fact, instead of granting, like an ordinary judge, sufficient or\n",
      "ample damages to the plaintiff, the sovereign adjudged to her use and\n",
      "benefit the palace and the ground. Nor was Theophilus content with this\n",
      "extravagant satisfaction: his zeal converted a civil trespass into a\n",
      "criminal act; and the unfortunate patrician was stripped and scourged\n",
      "in the public place of Constantinople. For some venial offenses, some\n",
      "defect of equity or vigilance, the principal ministers, a prÊfect, a\n",
      "quÊstor, a captain of the guards, were banished or mutilated, or scalded\n",
      "with boiling pitch, or burnt alive in the hippodrome; and as these\n",
      "dreadful examples might be the effects of error or caprice, they must\n",
      "have alienated from his service the best and wisest of the citizens. But\n",
      "the pride of the monarch was flattered in the exercise of power, or,\n",
      "as he thought, of virtue; and the people, safe in their obscurity,\n",
      "applauded the danger and debasement of their superiors. This\n",
      "extraordinary rigor was justified, in some measure, by its salutary\n",
      "consequences; since, after a scrutiny of seventeen days, not a complaint\n",
      "or abuse could be found in the court or city; and it might be alleged\n",
      "that the Greeks could be ruled only with a rod of iron, and that the\n",
      "public interest is the motive and law of the supreme judge. Yet in the\n",
      "crime, or the suspicion, of treason, that judge is of all others the\n",
      "most credulous and partial. Theophilus might inflict a tardy vengeance\n",
      "on the assassins of Leo and the saviors of his father; but he enjoyed\n",
      "the fruits of their crime; and his jealous tyranny sacrificed a brother\n",
      "and a prince to the future safety of his life. A Persian of the race of\n",
      "the Sassanides died in poverty and exile at Constantinople, leaving an\n",
      "only son, the issue of a plebeian marriage. At the age of twelve years,\n",
      "the royal birth of Theophobus was revealed, and his merit was not\n",
      "unworthy of his birth. He was educated in the Byzantine palace, a\n",
      "Christian and a soldier; advanced with rapid steps in the career of\n",
      "fortune and glory; received the hand of the emperor's sister; and was\n",
      "promoted to the command of thirty thousand Persians, who, like his\n",
      "father, had fled from the Mahometan conquerors. These troops, doubly\n",
      "infected with mercenary and fanatic vices, were desirous of revolting\n",
      "against their benefactor, and erecting the standard of their native\n",
      "king but the loyal Theophobus rejected their offers, disconcerted their\n",
      "schemes, and escaped from their hands to the camp or palace of his royal\n",
      "brother. A generous confidence might have secured a faithful and able\n",
      "guardian for his wife and his infant son, to whom Theophilus, in the\n",
      "flower of his age, was compelled to leave the inheritance of the empire.\n",
      "But his jealousy was exasperated by envy and disease; he feared the\n",
      "dangerous virtues which might either support or oppress their infancy\n",
      "and weakness; and the dying emperor demanded the head of the Persian\n",
      "prince. With savage delight he recognized the familiar features of his\n",
      "brother: \"Thou art no longer Theophobus,\" he said; and, sinking on his\n",
      "couch, he added, with a faltering voice, \"Soon, too soon, I shall be no\n",

      "property of his wife, he condemned the ship to the flames, with a sharp\n",
      "reproach, that her avarice had degraded the character of an empress\n",
      "into that of a merchant. Yet his last choice intrusted her with the\n",
      "guardianship of the empire and her son Michael, who was left an orphan\n",
      "in the fifth year of his age. The restoration of images, and the final\n",
      "extirpation of the Iconoclasts, has endeared her name to the devotion of\n",
      "the Greeks; but in the fervor of religious zeal, Theodora entertained\n",
      "a grateful regard for the memory and salvation of her husband. After\n",
      "thirteen years of a prudent and frugal administration, she perceived the\n",
      "decline of her influence; but the second Irene imitated only the virtues\n",
      "of her predecessor. Instead of conspiring against the life or government\n",
      "of her son, she retired, without a struggle, though not without a\n",
      "murmur, to the solitude of private life, deploring the ingratitude, the\n",
      "vices, and the inevitable ruin, of the worthless youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the successors of Nero and Elagabalus, we have not hitherto\n",
      "found the imitation of their vices, the character of a Roman prince who\n",
      "considered pleasure as the object of life, and virtue as the enemy of\n",
      "pleasure. Whatever might have been the maternal care of Theodora in the\n",
      "education of Michael the Third, her unfortunate son was a king before\n",
      "he was a man. If the ambitious mother labored to check the progress of\n",
      "reason, she could not cool the ebullition of passion; and her selfish\n",
      "policy was justly repaid by the contempt and ingratitude of the\n",
      "headstrong youth. At the age of eighteen, he rejected her authority,\n",
      "without feeling his own incapacity to govern the empire and himself.\n",
      "With Theodora, all gravity and wisdom retired from the court; their\n",
      "place was supplied by the alternate dominion of vice and folly; and\n",
      "it was impossible, without forfeiting the public esteem, to acquire or\n",
      "preserve the favor of the emperor. The millions of gold and silver which\n",
      "had been accumulated for the service of the state, were lavished on the\n",
      "vilest of men, who flattered his passions and shared his pleasures; and\n",
      "in a reign of thirteen years, the richest of sovereigns was compelled\n",
      "to strip the palace and the churches of their precious furniture. Like\n",
      "Nero, he delighted in the amusements of the theatre, and sighed to be\n",
      "surpassed in the accomplishments in which he should have blushed\n",
      "to excel. Yet the studies of Nero in music and poetry betrayed some\n",
      "symptoms of a liberal taste; the more ignoble arts of the son of\n",
      "Theophilus were confined to the chariot-race of the hippodrome. The four\n",
      "factions which had agitated the peace, still amused the idleness, of\n",
      "the capital: for himself, the emperor assumed the blue livery; the three\n",
      "rival colors were distributed to his favorites, and in the vile though\n",
      "eager contention he forgot the dignity of his person and the safety of\n",
      "his dominions. He silenced the messenger of an invasion, who presumed to\n",
      "divert his attention in the most critical moment of the race; and by his\n",
      "command, the importunate beacons were extinguished, that too frequently\n",
      "spread the alarm from Tarsus to Constantinople. The most skilful\n",
      "charioteers obtained the first place in his confidence and esteem; their\n",
      "merit was profusely rewarded the emperor feasted in their houses, and\n",
      "presented their children at the baptismal font; and while he applauded\n",
      "his own popularity, he affected to blame the cold and stately reserve\n",
      "of his predecessors. The unnatural lusts which had degraded even the\n",
      "manhood of Nero, were banished from the world; yet the strength of\n",
      "Michael was consumed by the indulgence of love and intemperance. In\n",
      "his midnight revels, when his passions were inflamed by wine, he was\n",
      "provoked to issue the most sanguinary commands; and if any feelings of\n",
      "humanity were left, he was reduced, with the return of sense, to approve\n",
      "the salutary disobedience of his servants. But the most extraordinary\n",
      "feature in the character of Michael, is the profane mockery of the\n",
      "religion of his country. The superstition of the Greeks might indeed\n",
      "excite the smile of a philosopher; but his smile would have been\n",
      "rational and temperate, and he must have condemned the ignorant folly of\n",
      "a youth who insulted the objects of public veneration. A buffoon of\n",
      "the court was invested in the robes of the patriarch: his twelve\n",
      "metropolitans, among whom the emperor was ranked, assumed their\n",
      "ecclesiastical garments: they used or abused the sacred vessels of\n",
      "the altar; and in their bacchanalian feasts, the holy communion was\n",
      "administered in a nauseous compound of vinegar and mustard. Nor were\n",
      "these impious spectacles concealed from the eyes of the city. On the day\n",
      "of a solemn festival, the emperor, with his bishops or buffoons, rode on\n",
      "asses through the streets, encountered the true patriarch at the head\n",
      "of his clergy; and by their licentious shouts and obscene gestures,\n",
      "disordered the gravity of the Christian procession. The devotion of\n",
      "Michael appeared only in some offence to reason or piety: he received\n",
      "his theatrical crowns from the statue of the Virgin; and an Imperial\n",
      "tomb was violated for the sake of burning the bones of Constantine the\n",
      "Iconoclast. By this extravagant conduct, the son of Theophilus became\n",
      "as contemptible as he was odious: every citizen was impatient for the\n",
      "deliverance of his country; and even the favorites of the moment\n",
      "were apprehensive that a caprice might snatch away what a caprice\n",
      "had bestowed. In the thirtieth year of his age, and in the hour of\n",
      "intoxication and sleep, Michael the Third was murdered in his chamber by\n",
      "the founder of a new dynasty, whom the emperor had raised to an equality\n",
      "of rank and power.\n",
      "\n",
      "The genealogy of Basil the Macedonian (if it be not the spurious\n",
      "offspring of pride and flattery) exhibits a genuine picture of the\n",
      "revolution of the most illustrious families. The Arsacides, the rivals\n",
      "of Rome, possessed the sceptre of the East near four hundred years: a\n",
      "younger branch of these Parthian kings continued to reign in Armenia;\n",
      "and their royal descendants survived the partition and servitude of\n",
      "that ancient monarchy. Two of these, Artabanus and Chlienes, escaped or\n",
      "retired to the court of Leo the First: his bounty seated them in a safe\n",
      "and hospitable exile, in the province of Macedonia: Adrianople was their\n",
      "final settlement. During several generations they maintained the dignity\n",
      "of their birth; and their Roman patriotism rejected the tempting offers\n",
      "of the Persian and Arabian powers, who recalled them to their native\n",
      "country. But their splendor was insensibly clouded by time and poverty;\n",
      "and the father of Basil was reduced to a small farm, which he cultivated\n",
      "with his own hands: yet he scorned to disgrace the blood of the\n",
      "Arsacides by a plebeian alliance: his wife, a widow of Adrianople, was\n",
      "pleased to count among her ancestors the great Constantine; and their\n",
      "royal infant was connected by some dark affinity of lineage or country\n",
      "with the Macedonian Alexander. No sooner was he born, than the cradle of\n",
      "Basil, his family, and his city, were swept away by an inundation of\n",
      "the Bulgarians: he was educated a slave in a foreign land; and in this\n",
      "severe discipline, he acquired the hardiness of body and flexibility of\n",
      "mind which promoted his future elevation. In the age of youth or manhood\n",
      "he shared the deliverance of the Roman captives, who generously broke\n",
      "their fetters, marched through Bulgaria to the shores of the Euxine,\n",
      "defeated two armies of Barbarians, embarked in the ships which had been\n",
      "stationed for their reception, and returned to Constantinople, from\n",
      "whence they were distributed to their respective homes. But the freedom\n",
      "of Basil was naked and destitute: his farm was ruined by the calamities\n",
      "of war: after his father's death, his manual labor, or service, could\n",
      "no longer support a family of orphans and he resolved to seek a more\n",
      "conspicuous theatre, in which every virtue and every vice may lead\n",
      "to the paths of greatness. The first night of his arrival at\n",
      "Constantinople, without friends or money, the weary pilgrim slept on the\n",
      "steps of the church of St. Diomede: he was fed by the casual hospitality\n",
      "of a monk; and was introduced to the service of a cousin and namesake of\n",
      "the emperor Theophilus; who, though himself of a diminutive person,\n",
      "was always followed by a train of tall and handsome domestics. Basil\n",
      "attended his patron to the government of Peloponnesus; eclipsed, by his\n",
      "personal merit the birth and dignity of Theophilus, and formed a useful\n",
      "connection with a wealthy and charitable matron of Patras. Her spiritual\n",
      "or carnal love embraced the young adventurer, whom she adopted as her\n",
      "son. Danielis presented him with thirty slaves; and the produce of her\n",
      "bounty was expended in the support of his brothers, and the purchase\n",
      "of some large estates in Macedonia. His gratitude or ambition still\n",
      "attached him to the service of Theophilus; and a lucky accident\n",
      "recommended him to the notice of the court. A famous wrestler, in the\n",
      "train of the Bulgarian ambassadors, had defied, at the royal banquet,\n",
      "the boldest and most robust of the Greeks. The strength of Basil was\n",
      "praised; he accepted the challenge; and the Barbarian champion was\n",
      "overthrown at the first onset. A beautiful but vicious horse was\n",
      "condemned to be hamstrung: it was subdued by the dexterity and courage\n",
      "of the servant of Theophilus; and his conqueror was promoted to an\n",
      "honorable rank in the Imperial stables. But it was impossible to obtain\n",
      "the confidence of Michael, without complying with his vices; and his new\n",
      "favorite, the great chamberlain of the palace, was raised and supported\n",
      "by a disgraceful marriage with a royal concubine, and the dishonor of\n",
      "his sister, who succeeded to her place. The public administration had\n",
      "been abandoned to the CÊsar Bardas, the brother and enemy of Theodora;\n",
      "but the arts of female influence persuaded Michael to hate and to fear\n",
      "his uncle: he was drawn from Constantinople, under the pretence of a\n",
      "Cretan expedition, and stabbed in the tent of audience, by the sword of\n",
      "the chamberlain, and in the presence of the emperor. About a month after\n",
      "this execution, Basil was invested with the title of Augustus and the\n",
      "government of the empire. He supported this unequal association till his\n",
      "influence was fortified by popular esteem. His life was endangered by\n",
      "the caprice of the emperor; and his dignity was profaned by a second\n",
      "colleague, who had rowed in the galleys. Yet the murder of his\n",
      "benefactor must be condemned as an act of ingratitude and treason; and\n",
      "the churches which he dedicated to the name of St. Michael were a poor\n",
      "and puerile expiation of his guilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The different ages of Basil the First may be compared with those of\n",
      "Augustus. The situation of the Greek did not allow him in his earliest\n",
      "youth to lead an army against his country; or to proscribe the nobles\n",
      "of her sons; but his aspiring genius stooped to the arts of a slave;\n",
      "he dissembled his ambition and even his virtues, and grasped, with the\n",
      "bloody hand of an assassin, the empire which he ruled with the wisdom\n",
      "and tenderness of a parent. A private citizen may feel his interest\n",
      "repugnant to his duty; but it must be from a deficiency of sense or\n",
      "courage, that an absolute monarch can separate his happiness from his\n",
      "glory, or his glory from the public welfare. The life or panegyric of\n",
      "Basil has indeed been composed and published under the long reign of\n",
      "his descendants; but even their stability on the throne may be justly\n",
      "ascribed to the superior merit of their ancestor. In his character,\n",
      "his grandson Constantine has attempted to delineate a perfect image\n",
      "of royalty: but that feeble prince, unless he had copied a real model,\n",
      "could not easily have soared so high above the level of his own conduct\n",
      "or conceptions. But the most solid praise of Basil is drawn from the\n",
      "comparison of a ruined and a flourishing monarchy, that which he\n",
      "wrested from the dissolute Michael, and that which he bequeathed to\n",
      "the Mecedonian dynasty. The evils which had been sanctified by time and\n",
      "example, were corrected by his master-hand; and he revived, if not the\n",
      "national spirit, at least the order and majesty of the Roman empire.\n",
      "His application was indefatigable, his temper cool, his understanding\n",
      "vigorous and decisive; and in his practice he observed that rare and\n",
      "salutary moderation, which pursues each virtue, at an equal distance\n",
      "between the opposite vices. His military service had been confined to\n",
      "the palace: nor was the emperor endowed with the spirit or the talents\n",
      "of a warrior. Yet under his reign the Roman arms were again formidable\n",
      "to the Barbarians. As soon as he had formed a new army by discipline and\n",
      "exercise, he appeared in person on the banks of the Euphrates, curbed\n",
      "the pride of the Saracens, and suppressed the dangerous though just\n",
      "revolt of the ManichÊans. His indignation against a rebel who had long\n",
      "eluded his pursuit, provoked him to wish and to pray, that, by the grace\n",
      "of God, he might drive three arrows into the head of Chrysochir. That\n",
      "odious head, which had been obtained by treason rather than by valor,\n",
      "was suspended from a tree, and thrice exposed to the dexterity of the\n",
      "Imperial archer; a base revenge against the dead, more worthy of the\n",
      "times than of the character of Basil. But his principal merit was in the\n",
      "civil administration of the finances and of the laws. To replenish and\n",
      "exhausted treasury, it was proposed to resume the lavish and ill-placed\n",
      "gifts of his predecessor: his prudence abated one moiety of the\n",
      "restitution; and a sum of twelve hundred thousand pounds was instantly\n",
      "procured to answer the most pressing demands, and to allow some space\n",
      "for the mature operations of economy. Among the various schemes for the\n",
      "improvement of the revenue, a new mode was suggested of capitation, or\n",
      "tribute, which would have too much depended on the arbitrary discretion\n",
      "of the assessors. A sufficient list of honest and able agents was\n",
      "instantly produced by the minister; but on the more careful scrutiny of\n",
      "Basil himself, only two could be found, who might be safely intrusted\n",
      "with such dangerous powers; but they justified his esteem by declining\n",
      "his confidence. But the serious and successful diligence of the emperor\n",
      "established by degrees the equitable balance of property and payment,\n",
      "of receipt and expenditure; a peculiar fund was appropriated to each\n",
      "service; and a public method secured the interest of the prince and\n",
      "the property of the people. After reforming the luxury, he assigned two\n",
      "patrimonial estates to supply the decent plenty, of the Imperial table:\n",
      "the contributions of the subject were reserved for his defence; and the\n",
      "residue was employed in the embellishment of the capital and provinces.\n",
      "A taste for building, however costly, may deserve some praise and much\n",
      "excuse: from thence industry is fed, art is encouraged, and some object\n",
      "is attained of public emolument or pleasure: the use of a road, an\n",
      "aqueduct, or a hospital, is obvious and solid; and the hundred churches\n",
      "that arose by the command of Basil were consecrated to the devotion of\n",
      "the age. In the character of a judge he was assiduous and impartial;\n",
      "desirous to save, but not afraid to strike: the oppressors of the people\n",
      "were severely chastised; but his personal foes, whom it might be unsafe\n",
      "to pardon, were condemned, after the loss of their eyes, to a life of\n",
      "solitude and repentance. The change of language and manners demanded a\n",
      "revision of the obsolete jurisprudence of Justinian: the voluminous body\n",
      "of his Institutes, Pandects, Code, and Novels, was digested under forty\n",
      "titles, in the Greek idiom; and the Basilics, which were improved and\n",
      "completed by his son and grandson, must be referred to the original\n",
      "genius of the founder of their race. This glorious reign was terminated\n",
      "by an accident in the chase. A furious stag entangled his horns in\n",
      "the belt of Basil, and raised him from his horse: he was rescued by an\n",
      "attendant, who cut the belt and slew the animal; but the fall, or the\n",
      "fever, exhausted the strength of the aged monarch, and he expired in the\n",
      "palace amidst the tears of his family and people. If he struck off the\n",
      "head of the faithful servant for presuming to draw his sword against his\n",
      "sovereign, the pride of despotism, which had lain dormant in his life,\n",
      "revived in the last moments of despair, when he no longer wanted or\n",
      "valued the opinion of mankind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the four sons of the emperor, Constantine died before his father,\n",
      "whose grief and credulity were amused by a flattering impostor and a\n",
      "vain apparition. Stephen, the youngest, was content with the honors of\n",
      "a patriarch and a saint; both Leo and Alexander were alike invested with\n",
      "the purple, but the powers of government were solely exercised by the\n",
      "elder brother. The name of Leo the Sixth has been dignified with the\n",
      "title of _philosopher_; and the union of the prince and the sage, of the\n",
      "active and speculative virtues, would indeed constitute the perfection\n",
      "of human nature. But the claims of Leo are far short of this ideal\n",
      "excellence. Did he reduce his passions and appetites under the dominion\n",
      "of reason? His life was spent in the pomp of the palace, in the society\n",
      "of his wives and concubines; and even the clemency which he showed, and\n",
      "the peace which he strove to preserve, must be imputed to the softness\n",
      "and indolence of his character. Did he subdue his prejudices, and those\n",
      "of his subjects? His mind was tinged with the most puerile superstition;\n",
      "the influence of the clergy, and the errors of the people, were\n",
      "consecrated by his laws; and the oracles of Leo, which reveal, in\n",
      "prophetic style, the fates of the empire, are founded on the arts of\n",
      "astrology and divination. If we still inquire the reason of his sage\n",
      "appellation, it can only be replied, that the son of Basil was less\n",
      "ignorant than the greater part of his contemporaries in church and\n",
      "state; that his education had been directed by the learned Photius; and\n",
      "that several books of profane and ecclesiastical science were composed\n",
      "by the pen, or in the name, of the Imperial _philosopher_. But the\n",
      "reputation of his philosophy and religion was overthrown by a domestic\n",
      "vice, the repetition of his nuptials. The primitive ideas of the merit\n",
      "and holiness of celibacy were preached by the monks and entertained\n",
      "by the Greeks. Marriage was allowed as a necessary means for the\n",
      "propagation of mankind; after the death of either party, the survivor\n",
      "might satisfy, by a _second_ union, the weakness or the strength of\n",
      "the flesh: but a _third_ marriage was censured as a state of legal\n",
      "fornication; and a _fourth_ was a sin or scandal as yet unknown to the\n",
      "Christians of the East. In the beginning of his reign, Leo himself had\n",
      "abolished the state of concubines, and condemned, without annulling,\n",
      "third marriages: but his patriotism and love soon compelled him to\n",
      "violate his own laws, and to incur the penance, which in a similar\n",
      "case he had imposed on his subjects. In his three first alliances, his\n",
      "nuptial bed was unfruitful; the emperor required a female companion, and\n",
      "the empire a legitimate heir. The beautiful Zoe was introduced into the\n",
      "palace as a concubine; and after a trial of her fecundity, and the birth\n",
      "of Constantine, her lover declared his intention of legitimating the\n",
      "mother and the child, by the celebration of his fourth nuptials. But\n",
      "the patriarch Nicholas refused his blessing: the Imperial baptism of\n",
      "the young prince was obtained by a promise of separation; and the\n",
      "contumacious husband of Zoe was excluded from the communion of the\n",
      "faithful. Neither the fear of exile, nor the desertion of his brethren,\n",
      "nor the authority of the Latin church, nor the danger of failure or\n",
      "doubt in the succession to the empire, could bend the spirit of the\n",
      "inflexible monk. After the death of Leo, he was recalled from exile\n",
      "to the civil and ecclesiastical administration; and the edict of union\n",
      "which was promulgated in the name of Constantine, condemned the future\n",
      "scandal of fourth marriages, and left a tacit imputation on his own\n",
      "birth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Greek language, _purple_ and _porphyry_ are the same word: and as\n",
      "the colors of nature are invariable, we may learn, that a dark deep\n",
      "red was the Tyrian dye which stained the purple of the ancients. An\n",
      "apartment of the Byzantine palace was lined with porphyry: it was\n",
      "reserved for the use of the pregnant empresses; and the royal birth of\n",
      "their children was expressed by the appellation of _porphyrogenite_, or\n",
      "born in the purple. Several of the Roman princes had been blessed with\n",
      "an heir; but this peculiar surname was first applied to Constantine\n",
      "the Seventh. His life and titular reign were of equal duration; but of\n",
      "fifty-four years, six had elapsed before his father's death; and the\n",
      "son of Leo was ever the voluntary or reluctant subject of those who\n",
      "oppressed his weakness or abused his confidence. His uncle Alexander,\n",
      "who had long been invested with the title of Augustus, was the first\n",
      "colleague and governor of the young prince: but in a rapid career of\n",
      "vice and folly, the brother of Leo already emulated the reputation of\n",
      "Michael; and when he was extinguished by a timely death, he entertained\n",
      "a project of castrating his nephew, and leaving the empire to a\n",
      "worthless favorite. The succeeding years of the minority of Constantine\n",
      "were occupied by his mother Zoe, and a succession or council of seven\n",
      "regents, who pursued their interest, gratified their passions, abandoned\n",
      "the republic, supplanted each other, and finally vanished in the\n",
      "presence of a soldier. From an obscure origin, Romanus Lecapenus had\n",
      "raised himself to the command of the naval armies; and in the anarchy of\n",
      "the times, had deserved, or at least had obtained, the national esteem.\n",
      "With a victorious and affectionate fleet, he sailed from the mouth of\n",
      "the Danube into the harbor of Constantinople, and was hailed as the\n",
      "deliverer of the people, and the guardian of the prince. His supreme\n",
      "office was at first defined by the new appellation of father of\n",
      "the emperor; but Romanus soon disdained the subordinate powers of a\n",
      "minister, and assumed with the titles of CÊsar and Augustus, the full\n",
      "independence of royalty, which he held near five-and-twenty years. His\n",
      "three sons, Christopher, Stephen, and Constantine were successively\n",
      "adorned with the same honors, and the lawful emperor was degraded from\n",

      "preservation of his life and crown, he might still applaud his own\n",

      "modern history would have excused the ambition of Romanus: the powers\n",
      "and the laws of the empire were in his hand; the spurious birth of\n",
      "Constantine would have justified his exclusion; and the grave or the\n",
      "monastery was open to receive the son of the concubine. But Lecapenus\n",
      "does not appear to have possessed either the virtues or the vices of a\n",
      "tyrant. The spirit and activity of his private life dissolved away in\n",
      "the sunshine of the throne; and in his licentious pleasures, he forgot\n",
      "the safety both of the republic and of his family. Of a mild and\n",
      "religious character, he respected the sanctity of oaths, the innocence\n",
      "of the youth, the memory of his parents, and the attachment of the\n",
      "people. The studious temper and retirement of Constantine disarmed the\n",
      "jealousy of power: his books and music, his pen and his pencil, were a\n",
      "constant source of amusement; and if he could improve a scanty allowance\n",
      "by the sale of his pictures, if their price was not enhanced by the name\n",

      "could employ in the hour of adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fall of Romanus was occasioned by his own vices and those of his\n",
      "children. After the decease of Christopher, his eldest son, the two\n",
      "surviving brothers quarrelled with each other, and conspired against\n",
      "their father. At the hour of noon, when all strangers were regularly\n",
      "excluded from the palace, they entered his apartment with an armed\n",
      "force, and conveyed him, in the habit of a monk, to a small island in\n",
      "the Propontis, which was peopled by a religious community. The rumor\n",
      "of this domestic revolution excited a tumult in the city; but\n",
      "Porphyrogenitus alone, the true and lawful emperor, was the object\n",
      "of the public care; and the sons of Lecapenus were taught, by tardy\n",
      "experience, that they had achieved a guilty and perilous enterprise\n",
      "for the benefit of their rival. Their sister Helena, the wife of\n",
      "Constantine, revealed, or supposed, their treacherous design of\n",
      "assassinating her husband at the royal banquet. His loyal adherents were\n",
      "alarmed, and the two usurpers were prevented, seized, degraded from\n",
      "the purple, and embarked for the same island and monastery where their\n",
      "father had been so lately confined. Old Romanus met them on the beach\n",
      "with a sarcastic smile, and, after a just reproach of their folly and\n",
      "ingratitude, presented his Imperial colleagues with an equal share\n",
      "of his water and vegetable diet. In the fortieth year of his reign,\n",
      "Constantine the Seventh obtained the possession of the Eastern world,\n",
      "which he ruled or seemed to rule, near fifteen years. But he was devoid\n",
      "of that energy of character which could emerge into a life of action and\n",
      "glory; and the studies, which had amused and dignified his leisure,\n",
      "were incompatible with the serious duties of a sovereign. The emperor\n",
      "neglected the practice to instruct his son Romanus in the theory of\n",
      "government; while he indulged the habits of intemperance and sloth, he\n",
      "dropped the reins of the administration into the hands of Helena his\n",
      "wife; and, in the shifting scene of her favor and caprice, each minister\n",
      "was regretted in the promotion of a more worthless successor. Yet the\n",
      "birth and misfortunes of Constantine had endeared him to the Greeks;\n",
      "they excused his failings; they respected his learning, his innocence,\n",
      "and charity, his love of justice; and the ceremony of his funeral was\n",
      "mourned with the unfeigned tears of his subjects. The body, according\n",
      "to ancient custom, lay in state in the vestibule of the palace; and the\n",
      "civil and military officers, the patricians, the senate, and the clergy\n",
      "approached in due order to adore and kiss the inanimate corpse of their\n",
      "sovereign. Before the procession moved towards the Imperial sepulchre,\n",
      "a herald proclaimed this awful admonition: \"Arise, O king of the world,\n",
      "and obey the summons of the King of kings!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The death of Constantine was imputed to poison; and his son Romanus, who\n",
      "derived that name from his maternal grandfather, ascended the throne of\n",
      "Constantinople. A prince who, at the age of twenty, could be suspected\n",
      "of anticipating his inheritance, must have been already lost in the\n",
      "public esteem; yet Romanus was rather weak than wicked; and the largest\n",
      "share of the guilt was transferred to his wife, Theophano, a woman\n",
      "of base origin masculine spirit, and flagitious manners. The sense of\n",
      "personal glory and public happiness, the true pleasures of royalty,\n",
      "were unknown to the son of Constantine; and, while the two brothers,\n",
      "Nicephorus and Leo, triumphed over the Saracens, the hours which the\n",
      "emperor owed to his people were consumed in strenuous idleness. In the\n",
      "morning he visited the circus; at noon he feasted the senators; the\n",
      "greater part of the afternoon he spent in the _sphristerium_, or\n",
      "tennis-court, the only theatre of his victories; from thence he passed\n",
      "over to the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, hunted and killed four wild\n",
      "boars of the largest size, and returned to the palace, proudly content\n",
      "with the labors of the day. In strength and beauty he was conspicuous\n",
      "above his equals: tall and straight as a young cypress, his complexion\n",
      "was fair and florid, his eyes sparkling, his shoulders broad, his nose\n",
      "long and aquiline. Yet even these perfections were insufficient to fix\n",
      "the love of Theophano; and, after a reign of four years, she mingled\n",
      "for her husband the same deadly draught which she had composed for his\n",
      "father.\n",
      "\n",
      "By his marriage with this impious woman, Romanus the younger left two\n",
      "sons, Basil the Second and Constantine the Ninth, and two daughters,\n",
      "Theophano and Anne. The eldest sister was given to Otho the Second,\n",
      "emperor of the West; the younger became the wife of Wolodomir, great\n",
      "duke and apostle of Russia, and by the marriage of her granddaughter\n",
      "with Henry the First, king of France, the blood of the Macedonians, and\n",
      "perhaps of the Arsacides, still flows in the veins of the Bourbon line.\n",
      "After the death of her husband, the empress aspired to reign in the name\n",
      "of her sons, the elder of whom was five, and the younger only two,\n",
      "years of age; but she soon felt the instability of a throne which was\n",
      "supported by a female who could not be esteemed, and two infants who\n",
      "could not be feared. Theophano looked around for a protector, and threw\n",
      "herself into the arms of the bravest soldier; her heart was capacious;\n",
      "but the deformity of the new favorite rendered it more than probable\n",
      "that interest was the motive and excuse of her love. Nicephorus Phocus\n",
      "united, in the popular opinion, the double merit of a hero and a saint.\n",
      "In the former character, his qualifications were genuine and splendid:\n",
      "the descendant of a race illustrious by their military exploits, he\n",
      "had displayed in every station and in every province the courage of\n",
      "a soldier and the conduct of a chief; and Nicephorus was crowned with\n",
      "recent laurels, from the important conquest of the Isle of Crete. His\n",
      "religion was of a more ambiguous cast; and his hair-cloth, his fasts,\n",
      "his pious idiom, and his wish to retire from the business of the world,\n",
      "were a convenient mask for his dark and dangerous ambition. Yet he\n",
      "imposed on a holy patriarch, by whose influence, and by a decree of the\n",
      "senate, he was intrusted, during the minority of the young princes, with\n",
      "the absolute and independent command of the Oriental armies. As soon\n",
      "as he had secured the leaders and the troops, he boldly marched to\n",
      "Constantinople, trampled on his enemies, avowed his correspondence with\n",
      "the empress, and without degrading her sons, assumed, with the title of\n",
      "Augustus, the preeminence of rank and the plenitude of power. But his\n",
      "marriage with Theophano was refused by the same patriarch who had placed\n",
      "the crown on his head: by his second nuptials he incurred a year of\n",
      "canonical penance; a bar of spiritual affinity was opposed to their\n",
      "celebration; and some evasion and perjury were required to silence the\n",
      "scruples of the clergy and people. The popularity of the emperor was\n",
      "lost in the purple: in a reign of six years he provoked the hatred\n",
      "of strangers and subjects: and the hypocrisy and avarice of the first\n",
      "Nicephorus were revived in his successor. Hypocrisy I shall never\n",
      "justify or palliate; but I will dare to observe, that the odious vice of\n",
      "avarice is of all others most hastily arraigned, and most unmercifully\n",
      "condemned. In a private citizen, our judgment seldom expects an accurate\n",
      "scrutiny into his fortune and expense; and in a steward of the public\n",
      "treasure, frugality is always a virtue, and the increase of taxes too\n",
      "often an indispensable duty. In the use of his patrimony, the generous\n",
      "temper of Nicephorus had been proved; and the revenue was strictly\n",
      "applied to the service of the state: each spring the emperor marched\n",

      "Among the warriors who promoted his elevation, and served under his\n",
      "standard, a noble and valiant Armenian had deserved and obtained\n",
      "the most eminent rewards. The stature of John Zimisces was below the\n",
      "ordinary standard: but this diminutive body was endowed with strength,\n",
      "beauty, and the soul of a hero. By the jealousy of the emperor's\n",
      "brother, he was degraded from the office of general of the East, to that\n",
      "of director of the posts, and his murmurs were chastised with disgrace\n",
      "and exile. But Zimisces was ranked among the numerous lovers of the\n",
      "empress: on her intercession, he was permitted to reside at Chalcedon,\n",
      "in the neighborhood of the capital: her bounty was repaid in his\n",
      "clandestine and amorous visits to the palace; and Theophano consented,\n",
      "with alacrity, to the death of an ugly and penurious husband. Some bold\n",
      "and trusty conspirators were concealed in her most private chambers: in\n",
      "the darkness of a winter night, Zimisces, with his principal companions,\n",
      "embarked in a small boat, traversed the Bosphorus, landed at the palace\n",
      "stairs, and silently ascended a ladder of ropes, which was cast down by\n",
      "the female attendants. Neither his own suspicions, nor the warnings\n",
      "of his friends, nor the tardy aid of his brother Leo, nor the fortress\n",
      "which he had erected in the palace, could protect Nicephorus from a\n",
      "domestic foe, at whose voice every door was open to the assassins. As\n",
      "he slept on a bear-skin on the ground, he was roused by their noisy\n",
      "intrusion, and thirty daggers glittered before his eyes. It is doubtful\n",
      "whether Zimisces imbrued his hands in the blood of his sovereign; but he\n",
      "enjoyed the inhuman spectacle of revenge. The murder was protracted by\n",
      "insult and cruelty: and as soon as the head of Nicephorus was shown from\n",
      "the window, the tumult was hushed, and the Armenian was emperor of the\n",
      "East. On the day of his coronation, he was stopped on the threshold of\n",
      "St. Sophia, by the intrepid patriarch; who charged his conscience with\n",
      "the deed of treason and blood; and required, as a sign of repentance,\n",
      "that he should separate himself from his more criminal associate. This\n",
      "sally of apostolic zeal was not offensive to the prince, since he could\n",
      "neither love nor trust a woman who had repeatedly violated the most\n",
      "sacred obligations; and Theophano, instead of sharing his imperial\n",
      "fortune, was dismissed with ignominy from his bed and palace. In their\n",
      "last interview, she displayed a frantic and impotent rage; accused\n",
      "the ingratitude of her lover; assaulted, with words and blows, her son\n",
      "Basil, as he stood silent and submissive in the presence of a\n",
      "superior colleague; and avowed her own prostitution in proclaiming the\n",
      "illegitimacy of his birth. The public indignation was appeased by her\n",
      "exile, and the punishment of the meaner accomplices: the death of an\n",
      "unpopular prince was forgiven; and the guilt of Zimisces was forgotten\n",
      "in the splendor of his virtues. Perhaps his profusion was less useful\n",
      "to the state than the avarice of Nicephorus; but his gentle and generous\n",
      "behavior delighted all who approached his person; and it was only in the\n",
      "paths of victory that he trod in the footsteps of his predecessor. The\n",
      "greatest part of his reign was employed in the camp and the field:\n",
      "his personal valor and activity were signalized on the Danube and the\n",
      "Tigris, the ancient boundaries of the Roman world; and by his double\n",
      "triumph over the Russians and the Saracens, he deserved the titles of\n",
      "savior of the empire, and conqueror of the East. In his last return from\n",
      "Syria, he observed that the most fruitful lands of his new provinces\n",
      "were possessed by the eunuchs. \"And is it for them,\" he exclaimed, with\n",
      "honest indignation, \"that we have fought and conquered? Is it for them\n",
      "that we shed our blood, and exhaust the treasures of our people?\" The\n",
      "complaint was reÎchoed to the palace, and the death of Zimisces is\n",
      "strongly marked with the suspicion of poison.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under this usurpation, or regency, of twelve years, the two lawful\n",
      "emperors, Basil and Constantine, had silently grown to the age of\n",
      "manhood. Their tender years had been incapable of dominion: the\n",
      "respectful modesty of their attendance and salutation was due to the age\n",
      "and merit of their guardians; the childless ambition of those guardians\n",
      "had no temptation to violate their right of succession: their patrimony\n",
      "was ably and faithfully administered; and the premature death of\n",
      "Zimisces was a loss, rather than a benefit, to the sons of Romanus.\n",
      "Their want of experience detained them twelve years longer the obscure\n",
      "and voluntary pupils of a minister, who extended his reign by persuading\n",
      "them to indulge the pleasures of youth, and to disdain the labors of\n",
      "government. In this silken web, the weakness of Constantine was forever\n",
      "entangled; but his elder brother felt the impulse of genius and the\n",
      "desire of action; he frowned, and the minister was no more. Basil\n",
      "was the acknowledged sovereign of Constantinople and the provinces\n",
      "of Europe; but Asia was oppressed by two veteran generals, Phocas and\n",
      "Sclerus, who, alternately friends and enemies, subjects and rebels,\n",
      "maintained their independence, and labored to emulate the example of\n",
      "successful usurpation. Against these domestic enemies the son of Romanus\n",
      "first drew his sword, and they trembled in the presence of a lawful and\n",
      "high-spirited prince. The first, in the front of battle, was thrown from\n",
      "his horse, by the stroke of poison, or an arrow; the second, who had\n",
      "been twice loaded with chains, and twice invested with the purple, was\n",
      "desirous of ending in peace the small remainder of his days. As the\n",
      "aged suppliant approached the throne, with dim eyes and faltering steps,\n",
      "leaning on his two attendants, the emperor exclaimed, in the insolence\n",
      "of youth and power, \"And is this the man who has so long been the object\n",
      "of our terror?\" After he had confirmed his own authority, and the peace\n",
      "of the empire, the trophies of Nicephorus and Zimisces would not\n",
      "suffer their royal pupil to sleep in the palace. His long and frequent\n",
      "expeditions against the Saracens were rather glorious than useful to the\n",
      "empire; but the final destruction of the kingdom of Bulgaria appears,\n",
      "since the time of Belisarius, the most important triumph of the Roman\n",
      "arms. Yet, instead of applauding their victorious prince, his subjects\n",
      "detested the rapacious and rigid avarice of Basil; and in the imperfect\n",
      "narrative of his exploits, we can only discern the courage, patience,\n",
      "and ferociousness of a soldier. A vicious education, which could not\n",
      "subdue his spirit, had clouded his mind; he was ignorant of every\n",
      "science; and the remembrance of his learned and feeble grandsire might\n",
      "encourage his real or affected contempt of laws and lawyers, of artists\n",
      "and arts. Of such a character, in such an age, superstition took a firm\n",
      "and lasting possession; after the first license of his youth, Basil the\n",
      "Second devoted his life, in the palace and the camp, to the penance of\n",
      "a hermit, wore the monastic habit under his robes and armor, observed a\n",
      "vow of continence, and imposed on his appetites a perpetual abstinence\n",
      "from wine and flesh. In the sixty-eighth year of his age, his martial\n",
      "spirit urged him to embark in person ferso the clergy and the curse of\n",
      "the people. After his decease, his brother Constantine enjoyed, about\n",
      "three years, the power, ersrather the pleasures, of royalty; and his\n",
      "only care was the settlement of the succession. He had enjoyed sixty-six\n",
      "years the title of Augustus; and the reign of the two brothers is the\n",
      "longest, and most obscure, of the Byzantine history.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lineal succession of five emperors, in a period of one hundred and\n",
      "sixty years, had attached the loyalty of the Greeks to the Macedonian\n",
      "dynasty, which had been thrice respected by the usurpers of their power.\n",
      "After the death of Constantine the Ninth, the last male of the royal\n",
      "race, a new and broken scene presents itself, and the accumulated years\n",
      "of twelve emperors do not equal the space of his single reign. His elder\n",
      "brother had preferred his private chastity to the public interest, and\n",
      "Constantine himself had only three daughters; Eudocia, who took the\n",
      "veil, and Zoe and Theodora, who were preserved till a mature age in a\n",
      "state of ignorance and virginity. When their marriage was discussed in\n",
      "the council of their dying father, the cold erspious Theodora refused\n",
      "to give an heir to the empire, but her sister Zoe presented herself a\n",
      "willing victim at the altar. Romanus Argyrus, a patrician of a graceful\n",
      "person and fair reputation, was chosen for her husband, and, on his\n",
      "declining that blindness or death was the second alternative. The\n",
      "motive of his reluctance was conjugal affection but his faithful wife\n",
      "sacrificed her own happiness to his safety and greatness; and her\n",
      "entrance into a monastery removed the only bar to the Imperial nuptials.\n",
      "After the decease of Constantine, the sceptre devolved to Romanus\n",
      "the Third; but his labors at the indulgence of pleasure. Her favorite\n",
      "chamberlain was a handsome Paphlagonian of the name of Michael, whose\n",
      "first trade had been that of a money-changer; and Romanus, either from\n",
      "gratitude, connived at their criminal intercourse, accepted\n",
      "a slight assurance of their innocence. But Zoe soon justified the Roman\n",
      "maxim, that every adulteress is capable of poisoning her husband; and\n",
      "the death of Romanus was instantly followed by the scandalous marriage\n",
      "and elevation of Michael the Fourth. The expectations of Zoe were,\n",
      "however, disappointed: instead of a vigorous and grateful lover, she\n",
      "had placed in her bed a miserable wretch, whose health and reason\n",
      "were impaired by epileptic fits, and whose conscience was tormented by\n",
      "despair and remorse. The most skilful physicians of the mind and\n",
      "body were summoned to his aid; and his hopes were amused by frequent\n",
      "pilgrimages to the baths, and to the tombs of the most popular saints;\n",
      "the monks applauded his penance, and, except restitution, (but to whom\n",
      "should he have restored?) Michael sought every method of expiating his\n",
      "guilt. While he groaned and prayed in sackcloth and ashes, his brother,\n",
      "the eunuch John, smiled at his remorse, and enjoyed the harvest of\n",
      "a crime of which himself was the secret and most guilty author. His\n",
      "administration was only the art of satiating his avarice, and Zoe became\n",
      "a captive in the palace of her fathers, and in the hands of her slaves.\n",
      "When he perceived the irretrievable decline of his brother's health,\n",
      "he introduced his nephew, another Michael, who derived his surname of\n",
      "Calaphates from his father's occupation in the careening of vessels:\n",
      "at the command of the eunuch, Zoe adopted for her son the son of a\n",
      "mechanic; and this fictitious heir was invested with the title and\n",
      "purple of the CÊsars, in the presence of the senate and clergy. So\n",
      "feeble was the character of Zoe, that she was oppressed by the liberty\n",
      "and power which she recovered by the death of the Paphlagonian; and at\n",
      "the end of four days, she placed the crown on the head of Michael the\n",
      "Fifth, who had protested, with tears and oaths, that he should ever\n",
      "reign the first and most obedient of her subjects. The only act of his\n",
      "short reign was his base ingratitude to his benefactors, the eunuch and\n",
      "the empress. The disgrace of the former was pleasing to the public: but\n",
      "the murmurs, and at length the clamors, of Constantinople deplored\n",
      "the exile of Zoe, the daughter of so many emperors; her vices were\n",
      "forgotten, and Michael was taught, that there is a period in which the\n",
      "patience of the tamest slaves rises into fury and revenge. The citizens\n",
      "of every degree assembled in a formidable tumult which lasted three\n",
      "days; they besieged the palace, forced the gates, recalled their\n",
      "_mothers_, Zoe from her prison, Theodora from her monastery, and\n",
      "condemned the son of Calaphates to the loss of his eyes or of his life.\n",
      "For the first time the Greeks beheld with surprise the two royal sisters\n",
      "seated on the same throne, presiding in the senate, and giving audience\n",
      "to the ambassadors of the nations. But the singular union subsisted no\n",
      "more than two months; the two sovereigns, their tempers, interests,\n",
      "and adherents, were secretly hostile to each other; and as Theodora was\n",
      "still averse to marriage, the indefatigable Zoe, at the age of sixty,\n",
      "consented, for the public good, to sustain the embraces of a third\n",
      "husband, and the censures of the Greek church. His name and number\n",
      "were Constantine the Tenth, and the epithet of _Monomachus_, the single\n",
      "combatant, must have been expressive of his valor and victory in some\n",
      "public or private quarrel. But his health was broken by the tortures\n",
      "of the gout, and his dissolute reign was spent in the alternative\n",
      "of sickness and pleasure. A fair and noble widow had accompanied\n",
      "Constantine in his exile to the Isle of Lesbos, and Sclerena gloried in\n",
      "the appellation of his mistress. After his marriage and elevation,\n",
      "she was invested with the title and pomp of _Augusta_, and occupied a\n",
      "contiguous apartment in the palace. The lawful consort (such was the\n",
      "delicacy or corruption of Zoe) consented to this strange and scandalous\n",
      "partition; and the emperor appeared in public between his wife and his\n",
      "concubine. He survived them both; but the last measures of Constantine\n",
      "to change the order of succession were prevented by the more vigilant\n",
      "friends of Theodora; and after his decease, she resumed, with the\n",
      "general consent, the possession of her inheritance. In her name, and by\n",
      "the influence of four eunuchs, the Eastern world was peaceably governed\n",
      "about nineteen months; and as they wished to prolong their dominion,\n",
      "they persuaded the aged princess to nominate for her successor\n",
      "Michael the Sixth. The surname of _Stratioticus_ declares his military\n",
      "profession; but the crazy and decrepit veteran could only see with the\n",
      "eyes, and execute with the hands, of his ministers. Whilst he ascended\n",
      "the throne, Theodora sunk into the grave; the last of the Macedonian\n",
      "or Basilian dynasty. I have hastily reviewed, and gladly dismiss, this\n",
      "shameful and destructive period of twenty-eight years, in which the\n",
      "Greeks, degraded below the common level of servitude, were transferred\n",
      "like a herd of cattle by the choice or caprice of two impotent females.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this night of slavery, a ray of freedom, or at least of spirit,\n",
      "begins to emerge: the Greeks either preserved or revived the use of\n",
      "surnames, which perpetuate the fame of hereditary virtue: and we now\n",
      "discern the rise, succession, and alliances of the last dynasties of\n",
      "Constantinople and Trebizond. The _Comneni_, who upheld for a while the\n",
      "fate of the sinking empire, assumed the honor of a Roman origin: but\n",
      "the family had been long since transported from Italy to Asia. Their\n",
      "patrimonial estate was situate in the district of Castamona, in the\n",
      "neighborhood of the Euxine; and one of their chiefs, who had already\n",
      "entered the paths of ambition, revisited with affection, perhaps with\n",
      "regret, the modest though honorable dwelling of his fathers. The first\n",
      "of their line was the illustrious Manuel, who in the reign of the second\n",
      "Basil, contributed by war and treaty to appease the troubles of the\n",
      "East: he left, in a tender age, two sons, Isaac and John, whom, with the\n",
      "consciousness of desert, he bequeathed to the gratitude and favor of his\n",
      "sovereign. The noble youths were carefully trained in the learning of\n",
      "the monastery, the arts of the palace, and the exercises of the camp:\n",
      "and from the domestic service of the guards, they were rapidly promoted\n",
      "to the command of provinces and armies. Their fraternal union doubled\n",
      "the force and reputation of the Comneni, and their ancient nobility was\n",
      "illustrated by the marriage of the two brothers, with a captive princess\n",
      "of Bulgaria, and the daughter of a patrician, who had obtained the name\n",
      "of _Charon_ from the number of enemies whom he had sent to the infernal\n",
      "shades. The soldiers had served with reluctant loyalty a series of\n",
      "effeminate masters; the elevation of Michael the Sixth was a personal\n",
      "insult to the more deserving generals; and their discontent was inflamed\n",
      "by the parsimony of the emperor and the insolence of the eunuchs. They\n",
      "secretly assembled in the sanctuary of St. Sophia, and the votes of the\n",
      "military synod would have been unanimous in favor of the old and valiant\n",
      "Catacalon, if the patriotism or modesty of the veteran had not suggested\n",
      "the importance of birth as well as merit in the choice of a sovereign.\n",
      "Isaac Comnenus was approved by general consent, and the associates\n",
      "separated without delay to meet in the plains of Phrygia at the head\n",
      "of their respective squadrons and detachments. The cause of Michael was\n",
      "defended in a single battle by the mercenaries of the Imperial guard,\n",
      "who were aliens to the public interest, and animated only by a principle\n",
      "of honor and gratitude. After their defeat, the fears of the emperor\n",
      "solicited a treaty, which was almost accepted by the moderation of\n",
      "the Comnenian. But the former was betrayed by his ambassadors, and the\n",
      "latter was prevented by his friends. The solitary Michael submitted\n",
      "to the voice of the people; the patriarch annulled their oath of\n",
      "allegiance; and as he shaved the head of the royal monk, congratulated\n",
      "his beneficial exchange of temporal royalty for the kingdom of heaven;\n",
      "an exchange, however, which the priest, on his own account, would\n",
      "probably have declined. By the hands of the same patriarch, Isaac\n",
      "Comnenus was solemnly crowned; the sword which he inscribed on his coins\n",
      "might be an offensive symbol, if it implied his title by conquest;\n",
      "but this sword would have been drawn against the foreign and domestic\n",
      "enemies of the state. The decline of his health and vigor suspended\n",
      "the operation of active virtue; and the prospect of approaching death\n",
      "determined him to interpose some moments between life and eternity. But\n",
      "instead of leaving the empire as the marriage portion of his daughter,\n",
      "his reason and inclination concurred in the preference of his brother\n",
      "John, a soldier, a patriot, and the father of five sons, the future\n",
      "pillars of an hereditary succession. His first modest reluctance might\n",
      "be the natural dictates of discretion and tenderness, but his obstinate\n",
      "and successful perseverance, however it may dazzle with the show of\n",
      "virtue, must be censured as a criminal desertion of his duty, and a rare\n",
      "offence against his family and country. The purple which he had refused\n",
      "was accepted by Constantine Ducas, a friend of the Comnenian house,\n",
      "and whose noble birth was adorned with the experience and reputation\n",
      "of civil policy. In the monastic habit, Isaac recovered his health,\n",
      "and survived two years his voluntary abdication. At the command of his\n",
      "abbot, he observed the rule of St. Basil, and executed the most servile\n",
      "offices of the convent: but his latent vanity was gratified by the\n",
      "frequent and respectful visits of the reigning monarch, who revered in\n",
      "his person the character of a benefactor and a saint.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Constantine the Eleventh were indeed the subject most worthy of\n",
      "empire, we must pity the debasement of the age and nation in which he\n",
      "was chosen. In the labor of puerile declamations he sought, without\n",
      "obtaining, the crown of eloquence, more precious, in his opinion, than\n",
      "that of Rome; and in the subordinate functions of a judge, he forgot the\n",
      "duties of a sovereign and a warrior. Far from imitating the patriotic\n",
      "indifference of the authors of his greatness, Ducas was anxious only to\n",
      "secure, at the expense of the republic, the power and prosperity of his\n",
      "children. His three sons, Michael the Seventh, Andronicus the First, and\n",
      "Constantine the Twelfth, were invested, in a tender age, with the equal\n",
      "title of Augustus; and the succession was speedily opened by\n",
      "their father's death. His widow, Eudocia, was intrusted with the\n",
      "administration; but experience had taught the jealousy of the dying\n",
      "monarch to protect his sons from the danger of her second nuptials; and\n",
      "her solemn engagement, attested by the principal senators, was deposited\n",
      "in the hands of the patriarch. Before the end of seven months, the wants\n",
      "of Eudocia, or those of the state, called aloud for the male virtues of\n",
      "a soldier; and her heart had already chosen Romanus Diogenes, whom she\n",
      "raised from the scaffold to the throne. The discovery of a treasonable\n",
      "attempt had exposed him to the severity of the laws: his beauty and\n",
      "valor absolved him in the eyes of the empress; and Romanus, from a mild\n",
      "exile, was recalled on the second day to the command of the Oriental\n",
      "armies. Her royal choice was yet unknown to the public; and the promise\n",
      "which would have betrayed her falsehood and levity, was stolen by a\n",
      "dexterous emissary from the ambition of the patriarch. Xiphilin at first\n",
      "alleged the sanctity of oaths, and the sacred nature of a trust; but a\n",
      "whisper, that his brother was the future emperor, relaxed his scruples,\n",
      "and forced him to confess that the public safety was the supreme law. He\n",
      "resigned the important paper; and when his hopes were confounded by the\n",
      "nomination of Romanus, he could no longer regain his security, retract\n",
      "his declarations, nor oppose the second nuptials of the empress. Yet\n",
      "a murmur was heard in the palace; and the Barbarian guards had raised\n",
      "their battle-axes in the cause of the house of Lucas, till the young\n",
      "princes were soothed by the tears of their mother and the solemn\n",
      "assurances of the fidelity of their guardian, who filled the Imperial\n",
      "station with dignity and honor. Hereafter I shall relate his valiant,\n",
      "but unsuccessful, efforts to resist the progress of the Turks. His\n",
      "defeat and captivity inflicted a deadly wound on the Byzantine monarchy\n",
      "of the East; and after he was released from the chains of the sultan, he\n",
      "vainly sought his wife and his subjects. His wife had been thrust into\n",
      "a monastery, and the subjects of Romanus had embraced the rigid maxim of\n",
      "the civil law, that a prisoner in the hands of the enemy is deprived,\n",
      "as by the stroke of death, of all the public and private rights of\n",
      "a citizen. In the general consternation, the CÊsar John asserted the\n",
      "indefeasible right of his three nephews: Constantinople listened to\n",
      "his voice: and the Turkish captive was proclaimed in the capital, and\n",
      "received on the frontier, as an enemy of the republic. Romanus was not\n",
      "more fortunate in domestic than in foreign war: the loss of two\n",
      "battles compelled him to yield, on the assurance of fair and honorable\n",
      "treatment; but his enemies were devoid of faith or humanity; and, after\n",
      "the cruel extinction of his sight, his wounds were left to bleed and\n",
      "corrupt, till in a few days he was relieved from a state of misery.\n",
      "Under the triple reign of the house of Ducas, the two younger brothers\n",
      "were reduced to the vain honors of the purple; but the eldest, the\n",
      "pusillanimous Michael, was incapable of sustaining the Roman sceptre;\n",
      "and his surname of _Parapinaces_ denotes the reproach which he shared\n",
      "with an avaricious favorite, who enhanced the price, and diminished the\n",
      "measure, of wheat. In the school of Psellus, and after the example of\n",
      "his mother, the son of Eudocia made some proficiency in philosophy and\n",
      "rhetoric; but his character was degraded, rather than ennobled, by the\n",
      "virtues of a monk and the learning of a sophist. Strong in the contempt\n",
      "of their sovereign and their own esteem, two generals, at the head of\n",
      "the European and Asiatic legions, assumed the purple at Adrianople and\n",
      "Nice. Their revolt was in the same months; they bore the same name of\n",
      "Nicephorus; but the two candidates were distinguished by the surnames\n",
      "of Bryennius and Botaniates; the former in the maturity of wisdom and\n",
      "courage, the latter conspicuous only by the memory of his past exploits.\n",
      "While Botaniates advanced with cautious and dilatory steps, his active\n",
      "competitor stood in arms before the gates of Constantinople. The name\n",
      "of Bryennius was illustrious; his cause was popular; but his licentious\n",
      "troops could not be restrained from burning and pillaging a suburb; and\n",
      "the people, who would have hailed the rebel, rejected and repulsed\n",
      "the incendiary of his country. This change of the public opinion\n",
      "was favorable to Botaniates, who at length, with an army of Turks,\n",
      "approached the shores of Chalcedon. A formal invitation, in the name\n",
      "of the patriarch, the synod, and the senate, was circulated through the\n",
      "streets of Constantinople; and the general assembly, in the dome of\n",
      "St. Sophia, debated, with order and calmness, on the choice of their\n",
      "sovereign. The guards of Michael would have dispersed this unarmed\n",
      "multitude; but the feeble emperor, applauding his own moderation and\n",
      "clemency, resigned the ensigns of royalty, and was rewarded with the\n",
      "monastic habit, and the title of Archbishop of Ephesus. He left a son,\n",
      "a Constantine, born and educated in the purple; and a daughter of the\n",
      "house of Ducas illustrated the blood, and confirmed the succession, of\n",
      "the Comnenian dynasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "John Comnenus, the brother of the emperor Isaac, survived in peace and\n",
      "dignity his generous refusal of the sceptre. By his wife Anne, a woman\n",
      "of masculine spirit and a policy, he left eight children: the three\n",
      "daughters multiplied the Comnenian alliance with the noblest of the\n",
      "Greeks: of the five sons, Manuel was stopped by a premature death; Isaac\n",
      "and Alexius restored the Imperial greatness of their house, which was\n",
      "enjoyed without toil or danger by the two younger brethren, Adrian and\n",
      "Nicephorus. Alexius, the third and most illustrious of the brothers was\n",
      "endowed by nature with the choicest gifts both of mind and body: they\n",
      "were cultivated by a liberal education, and exercised in the school of\n",
      "obedience and adversity. The youth was dismissed from the perils of the\n",
      "Turkish war, by the paternal care of the emperor Romanus: but the mother\n",
      "of the Comneni, with her aspiring face, was accused of treason, and\n",
      "banished, by the sons of Ducas, to an island in the Propontis. The two\n",
      "brothers soon emerged into favor and action, fought by each other's side\n",
      "against the rebels and Barbarians, and adhered to the emperor Michael,\n",
      "till he was deserted by the world and by himself. In his first interview\n",
      "with Botaniates, \"Prince,\" said Alexius with a noble frankness, \"my duty\n",
      "rendered me your enemy; the decrees of God and of the people have made\n",
      "me your subject. Judge of my future loyalty by my past opposition.\" The\n",
      "successor of Michael entertained him with esteem and confidence: his\n",
      "valor was employed against three rebels, who disturbed the peace of the\n",
      "empire, or at least of the emperors. Ursel, Bryennius, and Basilacius,\n",
      "were formidable by their numerous forces and military fame: they were\n",
      "successively vanquished in the field, and led in chains to the foot of\n",
      "the throne; and whatever treatment they might receive from a timid and\n",
      "cruel court, they applauded the clemency, as well as the courage, of\n",
      "their conqueror. But the loyalty of the Comneni was soon tainted by fear\n",
      "and suspicion; nor is it easy to settle between a subject and a despot,\n",
      "the debt of gratitude, which the former is tempted to claim by a revolt,\n",
      "and the latter to discharge by an executioner. The refusal of Alexius to\n",
      "march against a fourth rebel, the husband of his sister, destroyed\n",
      "the merit or memory of his past services: the favorites of Botaniates\n",
      "provoked the ambition which they apprehended and accused; and the\n",
      "retreat of the two brothers might be justified by the defence of their\n",
      "life and liberty. The women of the family were deposited in a sanctuary,\n",
      "respected by tyrants: the men, mounted on horseback, sallied from the\n",
      "city, and erected the standard of civil war. The soldiers who had been\n",
      "gradually assembled in the capital and the neighborhood, were devoted\n",
      "to the cause of a victorious and injured leader: the ties of common\n",
      "interest and domestic alliance secured the attachment of the house of\n",
      "Ducas; and the generous dispute of the Comneni was terminated by the\n",
      "decisive resolution of Isaac, who was the first to invest his younger\n",
      "brother with the name and ensigns of royalty. They returned to\n",
      "Constantinople, to threaten rather than besiege that impregnable\n",
      "fortress; but the fidelity of the guards was corrupted; a gate was\n",
      "surprised, and the fleet was occupied by the active courage of George\n",
      "PalÊologus, who fought against his father, without foreseeing that he\n",
      "labored for his posterity. Alexius ascended the throne; and his aged\n",
      "competitor disappeared in a monastery. An army of various nations was\n",
      "gratified with the pillage of the city; but the public disorders were\n",
      "expiated by the tears and fasts of the Comneni, who submitted to every\n",
      "penance compatible with the possession of the empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The life of the emperor Alexius has been delineated by a favorite\n",
      "daughter, who was inspired by a tender regard for his person and\n",
      "a laudable zeal to perpetuate his virtues. Conscious of the just\n",
      "suspicions of her readers, the princess Anna Comnena repeatedly\n",
      "protests, that, besides her personal knowledge, she had searched the\n",
      "discourses and writings of the most respectable veterans: and after an\n",
      "interval of thirty years, forgotten by, and forgetful of, the world, her\n",
      "mournful solitude was inaccessible to hope and fear; and that truth,\n",
      "the naked perfect truth, was more dear and sacred than the memory of her\n",
      "parent. Yet, instead of the simplicity of style and narrative which wins\n",
      "our belief, an elaborate affectation of rhetoric and science betrays\n",
      "in every page the vanity of a female author. The genuine character of\n",
      "Alexius is lost in a vague constellation of virtues; and the perpetual\n",
      "strain of panegyric and apology awakens our jealousy, to question the\n",
      "veracity of the historian and the merit of the hero. We cannot, however,\n",
      "refuse her judicious and important remark, that the disorders of the\n",
      "times were the misfortune and the glory of Alexius; and that every\n",
      "calamity which can afflict a declining empire was accumulated on his\n",
      "reign by the justice of Heaven and the vices of his predecessors. In the\n",
      "East, the victorious Turks had spread, from Persia to the Hellespont,\n",
      "the reign of the Koran and the Crescent: the West was invaded by the\n",
      "adventurous valor of the Normans; and, in the moments of peace, the\n",
      "Danube poured forth new swarms, who had gained, in the science of war,\n",
      "what they had lost in the ferociousness of manners. The sea was not less\n",
      "hostile than the land; and while the frontiers were assaulted by an open\n",
      "enemy, the palace was distracted with secret treason and conspiracy. On\n",
      "a sudden, the banner of the Cross was displayed by the Latins; Europe\n",
      "was precipitated on Asia; and Constantinople had almost been swept away\n",
      "by this impetuous deluge. In the tempest, Alexius steered the Imperial\n",
      "vessel with dexterity and courage. At the head of his armies, he was\n",
      "bold in action, skilful in stratagem, patient of fatigue, ready to\n",
      "improve his advantages, and rising from his defeats with inexhaustible\n",
      "vigor. The discipline of the camp was revived, and a new generation\n",
      "of men and soldiers was created by the example and precepts of their\n",
      "leader. In his intercourse with the Latins, Alexius was patient and\n",
      "artful: his discerning eye pervaded the new system of an unknown\n",
      "world and I shall hereafter describe the superior policy with which\n",
      "he balanced the interests and passions of the champions of the first\n",
      "crusade. In a long reign of thirty-seven years, he subdued and pardoned\n",
      "the envy of his equals: the laws of public and private order were\n",
      "restored: the arts of wealth and science were cultivated: the limits of\n",
      "the empire were enlarged in Europe and Asia; and the Comnenian sceptre\n",
      "was transmitted to his children of the third and fourth generation. Yet\n",
      "the difficulties of the times betrayed some defects in his character;\n",
      "and have exposed his memory to some just or ungenerous reproach. The\n",
      "reader may possibly smile at the lavish praise which his daughter\n",
      "so often bestows on a flying hero: the weakness or prudence of his\n",
      "situation might be mistaken for a want of personal courage; and his\n",
      "political arts are branded by the Latins with the names of deceit and\n",
      "dissimulation. The increase of the male and female branches of his\n",
      "family adorned the throne, and secured the succession; but their\n",
      "princely luxury and pride offended the patricians, exhausted the\n",
      "revenue, and insulted the misery of the people. Anna is a faithful\n",
      "witness that his happiness was destroyed, and his health was broken, by\n",
      "the cares of a public life; the patience of Constantinople was fatigued\n",
      "by the length and severity of his reign; and before Alexius expired, he\n",
      "had lost the love and reverence of his subjects. The clergy could not\n",
      "forgive his application of the sacred riches to the defence of the\n",
      "state; but they applauded his theological learning and ardent zeal for\n",
      "the orthodox faith, which he defended with his tongue, his pen, and his\n",
      "sword. His character was degraded by the superstition of the Greeks; and\n",
      "the same inconsistent principle of human nature enjoined the emperor to\n",
      "found a hospital for the poor and infirm, and to direct the execution\n",
      "of a heretic, who was burned alive in the square of St. Sophia. Even\n",
      "the sincerity of his moral and religious virtues was suspected by the\n",
      "persons who had passed their lives in his familiar confidence. In\n",
      "his last hours, when he was pressed by his wife Irene to alter the\n",
      "succession, he raised his head, and breathed a pious ejaculation on\n",
      "the vanity of this world. The indignant reply of the empress may be\n",
      "inscribed as an epitaph on his tomb, \"You die, as you have lived--a\n",
      "Hypocrite!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the wish of Irene to supplant the eldest of her surviving sons,\n",
      "in favor of her daughter the princess Anne whose philosophy would not\n",
      "have refused the weight of a diadem. But the order of male succession\n",
      "was asserted by the friends of their country; the lawful heir drew the\n",
      "royal signet from the finger of his insensible or conscious father and\n",
      "the empire obeyed the master of the palace. Anna Comnena was stimulated\n",
      "by ambition and revenge to conspire against the life of her brother, and\n",
      "when the design was prevented by the fears or scruples of her husband,\n",
      "she passionately exclaimed that nature had mistaken the two sexes, and\n",
      "had endowed Bryennius with the soul of a woman. The two sons of Alexius,\n",
      "John and Isaac, maintained the fraternal concord, the hereditary virtue\n",
      "of their race, and the younger brother was content with the title of\n",
      "_Sebastocrator_, which approached the dignity, without sharing the\n",
      "power, of the emperor. In the same person the claims of primogeniture\n",
      "and merit were fortunately united; his swarthy complexion, harsh\n",
      "features, and diminutive stature, had suggested the ironical surname of\n",
      "Calo-Johannes, or John the Handsome, which his grateful subjects more\n",
      "seriously applied to the beauties of his mind. After the discovery of\n",
      "her treason, the life and fortune of Anne were justly forfeited to the\n",
      "laws. Her life was spared by the clemency of the emperor; but he visited\n",
      "the pomp and treasures of her palace, and bestowed the rich confiscation\n",
      "on the most deserving of his friends. That respectable friend Axuch,\n",
      "a slave of Turkish extraction, presumed to decline the gift, and to\n",
      "intercede for the criminal: his generous master applauded and imitated\n",
      "the virtue of his favorite, and the reproach or complaint of an injured\n",

      "years, the penalty of death was abolished in the Roman empire, a law of\n",
      "mercy most delightful to the humane theorist, but of which the practice,\n",
      "in a large and vicious community, is seldom consistent with the\n",
      "public safety. Severe to himself, indulgent to others, chaste, frugal,\n",
      "abstemious, the philosophic Marcus would not have disdained the artless\n",

      "Byzantine court, so oppressive to the people, so contemptible to the eye\n",
      "of reason. Under such a prince, innocence had nothing to fear, and merit\n",
      "had every thing to hope; and, without assuming the tyrannic office of a\n",
      "censor, he introduced a gradual though visible reformation in the\n",
      "public and private manners of Constantinople. The only defect of this\n",
      "accomplished character was the frailty of noble minds, the love of arms\n",

      "of St. Sophia, who possessed a decisive voice in the consecration of an\n",
      "emperor. With his veteran and affectionate troops, Manuel soon visited\n",
      "Constantinople; his brother acquiesced in the title of Sebastocrator;\n",
      "his subjects admired the lofty stature and martial graces of their new\n",
      "sovereign, and listened with credulity to the flattering promise, that\n",
      "he blended the wisdom of age with the activity and vigor of youth. By\n",
      "the experience of his government, they were taught, that he emulated the\n",
      "spirit, and shared the talents, of his father whose social virtues\n",
      "were buried in the grave. A reign of thirty seven years is filled by a\n",
      "perpetual though various warfare against the Turks, the Christians, and\n",
      "the hordes of the wilderness beyond the Danube. The arms of Manuel were\n",
      "exercised on Mount Taurus, in the plains of Hungary, on the coast of\n",
      "Italy and Egypt, and on the seas of Sicily and Greece: the influence\n",
      "of his negotiations extended from Jerusalem to Rome and Russia; and the\n",
      "Byzantine monarchy, for a while, became an object of respect or terror\n",
      "to the powers of Asia and Europe. Educated in the silk and purple of the\n",
      "East, Manuel possessed the iron temper of a soldier, which cannot easily\n",
      "be paralleled, except in the lives of Richard the First of England, and\n",
      "of Charles the Twelfth of Sweden. Such was his strength and exercise in\n",
      "arms, that Raymond, surnamed the Hercules of Antioch, was incapable\n",
      "of wielding the lance and buckler of the Greek emperor. In a famous\n",
      "tournament, he entered the lists on a fiery courser, and overturned in\n",
      "his first career two of the stoutest of the Italian knights. The first\n",
      "in the charge, the last in the retreat, his friends and his enemies\n",
      "alike trembled, the former for his safety, and the latter for their own.\n",
      "After posting an ambuscade in a wood, he rode forwards in search of some\n",
      "perilous adventure, accompanied only by his brother and the faithful\n",
      "Axuch, who refused to desert their sovereign. Eighteen horsemen, after a\n",
      "short combat, fled before them: but the numbers of the enemy increased;\n",
      "the march of the reÎnforcement was tardy and fearful, and Manuel,\n",
      "without receiving a wound, cut his way through a squadron of five\n",
      "hundred Turks. In a battle against the Hungarians, impatient of the\n",
      "slowness of his troops, he snatched a standard from the head of the\n",
      "column, and was the first, almost alone, who passed a bridge that\n",
      "separated him from the enemy. In the same country, after transporting\n",
      "his army beyond the Save, he sent back the boats, with an order under\n",
      "pain of death, to their commander, that he should leave him to conquer\n",
      "or die on that hostile land. In the siege of Corfu, towing after him a\n",
      "captive galley, the emperor stood aloft on the poop, opposing against\n",
      "the volleys of darts and stones, a large buckler and a flowing sail;\n",
      "nor could he have escaped inevitable death, had not the Sicilian admiral\n",
      "enjoined his archers to respect the person of a hero. In one day, he is\n",
      "said to have slain above forty of the Barbarians with his own hand; he\n",
      "returned to the camp, dragging along four Turkish prisoners, whom he had\n",
      "tied to the rings of his saddle: he was ever the foremost to provoke or\n",
      "to accept a single combat; and the _gigantic_ champions, who encountered\n",
      "his arm, were transpierced by the lance, or cut asunder by the sword,\n",
      "of the invincible Manuel. The story of his exploits, which appear as\n",
      "a model or a copy of the romances of chivalry, may induce a reasonable\n",
      "suspicion of the veracity of the Greeks: I will not, to vindicate their\n",
      "credit, endanger my own: yet I may observe, that, in the long series\n",
      "of their annals, Manuel is the only prince who has been the subject of\n",
      "similar exaggeration. With the valor of a soldier, he did no unite the\n",
      "skill or prudence of a general; his victories were not productive of any\n",
      "permanent or useful conquest; and his Turkish laurels were blasted\n",
      "in his last unfortunate campaign, in which he lost his army in the\n",
      "mountains of Pisidia, and owed his deliverance to the generosity of the\n",
      "sultan. But the most singular feature in the character of Manuel, is\n",
      "the contrast and vicissitude of labor and sloth, of hardiness and\n",
      "effeminacy. In war he seemed ignorant of peace, in peace he appeared\n",
      "incapable of war. In the field he slept in the sun or in the snow, tired\n",
      "in the longest marches the strength of his men and horses, and shared\n",
      "with a smile the abstinence or diet of the camp. No sooner did he return\n",
      "to Constantinople, than he resigned himself to the arts and pleasures of\n",
      "a life of luxury: the expense of his dress, his table, and his palace,\n",
      "surpassed the measure of his predecessors, and whole summer days were\n",
      "idly wasted in the delicious isles of the Propontis, in the incestuous\n",
      "love of his niece Theodora. The double cost of a warlike and dissolute\n",
      "prince exhausted the revenue, and multiplied the taxes; and Manuel, in\n",
      "the distress of his last Turkish campaign, endured a bitter reproach\n",
      "from the mouth of a desperate soldier. As he quenched his thirst, he\n",
      "complained that the water of a fountain was mingled with Christian\n",
      "blood. \"It is not the first time,\" exclaimed a voice from the crowd,\n",
      "\"that you have drank, O emperor, the blood of your Christian subjects.\"\n",
      "Manuel Comnenus was twice married, to the virtuous Bertha or Irene\n",
      "of Germany, and to the beauteous Maria, a French or Latin princess of\n",
      "Antioch. The only daughter of his first wife was destined for Bela, a\n",
      "Hungarian prince, who was educated at Constantinople under the name of\n",
      "Alexius; and the consummation of their nuptials might have transferred\n",
      "the Roman sceptre to a race of free and warlike Barbarians. But as\n",
      "soon as Maria of Antioch had given a son and heir to the empire, the\n",
      "presumptive rights of Bela were abolished, and he was deprived of\n",
      "his promised bride; but the Hungarian prince resumed his name and the\n",
      "kingdom of his fathers, and displayed such virtues as might excite the\n",
      "regret and envy of the Greeks. The son of Maria was named Alexius; and\n",
      "at the age of ten years he ascended the Byzantine throne, after his\n",
      "father's decease had closed the glories of the Comnenian line.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fraternal concord of the two sons of the great Alexius had been\n",
      "sometimes clouded by an opposition of interest and passion. By ambition,\n",
      "Isaac the Sebastocrator was excited to flight and rebellion, from whence\n",
      "he was reclaimed by the firmness and clemency of John the Handsome. The\n",
      "errors of Isaac, the father of the emperors of Trebizond, were short and\n",
      "venial; but John, the elder of his sons, renounced forever his religion.\n",
      "Provoked by a real or imaginary insult of his uncle, he escaped from the\n",
      "Roman to the Turkish camp: his apostasy was rewarded with the sultan's\n",
      "daughter, the title of Chelebi, or noble, and the inheritance of a\n",
      "princely estate; and in the fifteenth century, Mahomet the Second\n",
      "boasted of his Imperial descent from the Comnenian family. Andronicus,\n",
      "the younger brother of John, son of Isaac, and grandson of Alexius\n",
      "Comnenus, is one of the most conspicuous characters of the age; and his\n",
      "genuine adventures might form the subject of a very singular romance. To\n",
      "justify the choice of three ladies of royal birth, it is incumbent on me\n",
      "to observe, that their fortunate lover was cast in the best proportions\n",
      "of strength and beauty; and that the want of the softer graces was\n",
      "supplied by a manly countenance, a lofty stature, athletic muscles, and\n",
      "the air and deportment of a soldier. The preservation, in his old age,\n",
      "of health and vigor, was the reward of temperance and exercise. A piece\n",
      "of bread and a draught of water was often his sole and evening repast;\n",
      "and if he tasted of a wild boar or a stag, which he had roasted with his\n",
      "own hands, it was the well-earned fruit of a laborious chase. Dexterous\n",
      "in arms, he was ignorant of fear; his persuasive eloquence could bend\n",
      "to every situation and character of life, his style, though not his\n",
      "practice, was fashioned by the example of St. Paul; and, in every deed\n",
      "of mischief, he had a heart to resolve, a head to contrive, and a\n",
      "hand to execute. In his youth, after the death of the emperor John, he\n",
      "followed the retreat of the Roman army; but, in the march through Asia\n",
      "Minor, design or accident tempted him to wander in the mountains: the\n",
      "hunter was encompassed by the Turkish huntsmen, and he remained some\n",
      "time a reluctant or willing captive in the power of the sultan. His\n",
      "virtues and vices recommended him to the favor of his cousin: he shared\n",
      "the perils and the pleasures of Manuel; and while the emperor lived\n",
      "in public incest with his niece Theodora, the affections of her sister\n",
      "Eudocia were seduced and enjoyed by Andronicus. Above the decencies of\n",
      "her sex and rank, she gloried in the name of his concubine; and both\n",
      "the palace and the camp could witness that she slept, or watched, in\n",
      "the arms of her lover. She accompanied him to his military command of\n",
      "Cilicia, the first scene of his valor and imprudence. He pressed, with\n",
      "active ardor, the siege of Mopsuestia: the day was employed in the\n",
      "boldest attacks; but the night was wasted in song and dance; and a band\n",
      "of Greek comedians formed the choicest part of his retinue. Andronicus\n",
      "was surprised by the sally of a vigilant foe; but, while his troops fled\n",
      "in disorder, his invincible lance transpierced the thickest ranks of\n",
      "the Armenians. On his return to the Imperial camp in Macedonia, he was\n",
      "received by Manuel with public smiles and a private reproof; but\n",
      "the duchies of Naissus, Braniseba, and Castoria, were the reward or\n",
      "consolation of the unsuccessful general. Eudocia still attended his\n",
      "motions: at midnight, their tent was suddenly attacked by her angry\n",
      "brothers, impatient to expiate her infamy in his blood: his daring\n",
      "spirit refused her advice, and the disguise of a female habit; and,\n",
      "boldly starting from his couch, he drew his sword, and cut his way\n",
      "through the numerous assassins. It was here that he first betrayed his\n",
      "ingratitude and treachery: he engaged in a treasonable correspondence\n",
      "with the king of Hungary and the German emperor; approached the royal\n",
      "tent at a suspicious hour with a drawn sword, and under the mask of a\n",
      "Latin soldier, avowed an intention of revenge against a mortal foe;\n",
      "and imprudently praised the fleetness of his horse as an instrument of\n",
      "flight and safety. The monarch dissembled his suspicions; but, after the\n",
      "close of the campaign, Andronicus was arrested and strictly confined in\n",
      "a tower of the palace of Constantinople.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this prison he was left about twelve years; a most painful restraint,\n",
      "from which the thirst of action and pleasure perpetually urged him to\n",
      "escape. Alone and pensive, he perceived some broken bricks in a corner\n",
      "of the chamber, and gradually widened the passage, till he had explored\n",
      "a dark and forgotten recess. Into this hole he conveyed himself, and\n",
      "the remains of his provisions, replacing the bricks in their former\n",
      "position, and erasing with care the footsteps of his retreat. At the\n",
      "hour of the customary visit, his guards were amazed by the silence\n",
      "and solitude of the prison, and reported, with shame and fear, his\n",
      "incomprehensible flight. The gates of the palace and city were instantly\n",
      "shut: the strictest orders were despatched into the provinces, for the\n",
      "recovery of the fugitive; and his wife, on the suspicion of a pious act,\n",
      "was basely imprisoned in the same tower. At the dead of night she beheld\n",
      "a spectre; she recognized her husband: they shared their provisions;\n",
      "and a son was the fruit of these stolen interviews, which alleviated\n",
      "the tediousness of their confinement. In the custody of a woman, the\n",
      "vigilance of the keepers was insensibly relaxed; and the captive had\n",
      "accomplished his real escape, when he was discovered, brought back to\n",
      "Constantinople, and loaded with a double chain. At length he found the\n",
      "moment, and the means, of his deliverance. A boy, his domestic servant,\n",
      "intoxicated the guards, and obtained in wax the impression of the keys.\n",
      "By the diligence of his friends, a similar key, with a bundle of ropes,\n",
      "was introduced into the prison, in the bottom of a hogshead. Andronicus\n",
      "employed, with industry and courage, the instruments of his safety,\n",
      "unlocked the doors, descended from the tower, concealed himself all day\n",
      "among the bushes, and scaled in the night the garden-wall of the palace.\n",
      "A boat was stationed for his reception: he visited his own house,\n",
      "embraced his children, cast away his chain, mounted a fleet horse, and\n",
      "directed his rapid course towards the banks of the Danube. At Anchialus\n",
      "in Thrace, an intrepid friend supplied him with horses and money: he\n",
      "passed the river, traversed with speed the desert of Moldavia and the\n",
      "Carpathian hills, and had almost reached the town of Halicz, in the\n",
      "Polish Russia, when he was intercepted by a party of Walachians, who\n",
      "resolved to convey their important captive to Constantinople. His\n",
      "presence of mind again extricated him from danger. Under the pretence of\n",
      "sickness, he dismounted in the night, and was allowed to step aside from\n",
      "the troop: he planted in the ground his long staff, clothed it with his\n",
      "cap and upper garment; and, stealing into the wood, left a phantom to\n",
      "amuse, for some time, the eyes of the Walachians. From Halicz he was\n",
      "honorably conducted to Kiow, the residence of the great duke: the\n",
      "subtle Greek soon obtained the esteem and confidence of Ieroslaus; his\n",
      "character could assume the manners of every climate; and the Barbarians\n",
      "applauded his strength and courage in the chase of the elks and bears\n",
      "of the forest. In this northern region he deserved the forgiveness\n",
      "of Manuel, who solicited the Russian prince to join his arms in the\n",
      "invasion of Hungary. The influence of Andronicus achieved this important\n",
      "service: his private treaty was signed with a promise of fidelity on one\n",
      "side, and of oblivion on the other; and he marched, at the head of the\n",
      "Russian cavalry, from the Borysthenes to the Danube. In his resentment\n",
      "Manuel had ever sympathized with the martial and dissolute character of\n",
      "his cousin; and his free pardon was sealed in the assault of Zemlin, in\n",
      "which he was second, and second only, to the valor of the emperor.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner was the exile restored to freedom and his country, than his\n",
      "ambition revived, at first to his own, and at length to the public,\n",
      "misfortune. A daughter of Manuel was a feeble bar to the succession of\n",
      "the more deserving males of the Comnenian blood; her future marriage\n",
      "with the prince of Hungary was repugnant to the hopes or prejudices of\n",
      "the princes and nobles. But when an oath of allegiance was required to\n",
      "the presumptive heir, Andronicus alone asserted the honor of the Roman\n",
      "name, declined the unlawful engagement, and boldly protested against the\n",
      "adoption of a stranger. His patriotism was offensive to the emperor, but\n",
      "he spoke the sentiments of the people, and was removed from the royal\n",
      "presence by an honorable banishment, a second command of the Cilician\n",
      "frontier, with the absolute disposal of the revenues of Cyprus. In\n",
      "this station the Armenians again exercised his courage and exposed his\n",
      "negligence; and the same rebel, who baffled all his operations, was\n",
      "unhorsed, and almost slain by the vigor of his lance. But Andronicus\n",
      "soon discovered a more easy and pleasing conquest, the beautiful\n",
      "Philippa, sister of the empress Maria, and daughter of Raymond of\n",
      "Poitou, the Latin prince of Antioch. For her sake he deserted his\n",
      "station, and wasted the summer in balls and tournaments: to his love\n",
      "she sacrificed her innocence, her reputation, and the offer of an\n",
      "advantageous marriage. But the resentment of Manuel for this domestic\n",
      "affront interrupted his pleasures: Andronicus left the indiscreet\n",
      "princess to weep and to repent; and, with a band of desperate\n",
      "adventurers, undertook the pilgrimage of Jerusalem. His birth, his\n",
      "martial renown, and professions of zeal, announced him as the champion\n",
      "of the Cross: he soon captivated both the clergy and the king; and the\n",
      "Greek prince was invested with the lordship of Berytus, on the coast of\n",
      "Phnicia. In his neighborhood resided a young and handsome queen, of his\n",
      "own nation and family, great-granddaughter of the emperor Alexis, and\n",
      "widow of Baldwin the Third, king of Jerusalem. She visited and loved her\n",
      "kinsman. Theodora was the third victim of his amorous seduction; and her\n",
      "shame was more public and scandalous than that of her predecessors. The\n",
      "emperor still thirsted for revenge; and his subjects and allies of the\n",
      "Syrian frontier were repeatedly pressed to seize the person, and put out\n",
      "the eyes, of the fugitive. In Palestine he was no longer safe; but the\n",
      "tender Theodora revealed his danger, and accompanied his flight. The\n",
      "queen of Jerusalem was exposed to the East, his obsequious concubine;\n",
      "and two illegitimate children were the living monuments of her weakness.\n",
      "Damascus was his first refuge; and, in the characters of the great\n",
      "Noureddin and his servant Saladin, the superstitious Greek might learn\n",
      "to revere the virtues of the Mussulmans. As the friend of Noureddin he\n",
      "visited, most probably, Bagdad, and the courts of Persia; and, after\n",
      "a long circuit round the Caspian Sea and the mountains of Georgia, he\n",
      "finally settled among the Turks of Asia Minor, the hereditary enemies\n",
      "of his country. The sultan of Colonia afforded a hospitable retreat to\n",
      "Andronicus, his mistress, and his band of outlaws: the debt of gratitude\n",
      "was paid by frequent inroads in the Roman province of Trebizond; and\n",
      "he seldom returned without an ample harvest of spoil and of Christian\n",
      "captives. In the story of his adventures, he was fond of comparing\n",
      "himself to David, who escaped, by a long exile, the snares of the\n",
      "wicked. But the royal prophet (he presumed to add) was content to lurk\n",
      "on the borders of JudÊa, to slay an Amalekite, and to threaten, in his\n",
      "miserable state, the life of the avaricious Nabal. The excursions of the\n",
      "Comnenian prince had a wider range; and he had spread over the Eastern\n",
      "world the glory of his name and religion. By a sentence of the Greek\n",
      "church, the licentious rover had been separated from the faithful;\n",
      "but even this excommunication may prove, that he never abjured the\n",
      "profession of Christianity.\n",
      "\n",
      "His vigilance had eluded or repelled the open and secret persecution\n",
      "of the emperor; but he was at length insnared by the captivity of his\n",
      "female companion. The governor of Trebizond succeeded in his attempt\n",
      "to surprise the person of Theodora: the queen of Jerusalem and her two\n",
      "children were sent to Constantinople, and their loss imbittered the\n",
      "tedious solitude of banishment. The fugitive implored and obtained a\n",
      "final pardon, with leave to throw himself at the feet of his sovereign,\n",
      "who was satisfied with the submission of this haughty spirit. Prostrate\n",
      "on the ground, he deplored with tears and groans the guilt of his past\n",
      "rebellion; nor would he presume to arise, unless some faithful subject\n",
      "would drag him to the foot of the throne, by an iron chain with which he\n",
      "had secretly encircled his neck. This extraordinary penance excited the\n",
      "wonder and pity of the assembly; his sins were forgiven by the church\n",
      "and state; but the just suspicion of Manuel fixed his residence at a\n",
      "distance from the court, at Oenoe, a town of Pontus, surrounded with\n",
      "rich vineyards, and situate on the coast of the Euxine. The death of\n",
      "Manuel, and the disorders of the minority, soon opened the fairest field\n",
      "to his ambition. The emperor was a boy of twelve or fourteen years of\n",
      "age, without vigor, or wisdom, or experience: his mother, the empress\n",
      "Mary, abandoned her person and government to a favorite of the Comnenian\n",
      "name; and his sister, another Mary, whose husband, an Italian, was\n",
      "decorated with the title of CÊsar, excited a conspiracy, and at length\n",
      "an insurrection, against her odious step-mother. The provinces were\n",
      "forgotten, the capital was in flames, and a century of peace and order\n",
      "was overthrown in the vice and weakness of a few months. A civil war was\n",
      "kindled in Constantinople; the two factions fought a bloody battle in\n",
      "the square of the palace, and the rebels sustained a regular siege in\n",
      "the cathedral of St. Sophia. The patriarch labored with honest zeal to\n",
      "heal the wounds of the republic, the most respectable patriots called\n",
      "aloud for a guardian and avenger, and every tongue repeated the praise\n",
      "of the talents and even the virtues of Andronicus. In his retirement,\n",
      "he affected to revolve the solemn duties of his oath: \"If the safety or\n",
      "honor of the Imperial family be threatened, I will reveal and oppose\n",
      "the mischief to the utmost of my power.\" His correspondence with the\n",
      "patriarch and patricians was seasoned with apt quotations from the\n",
      "Psalms of David and the epistles of St. Paul; and he patiently waited\n",
      "till he was called to her deliverance by the voice of his country. In\n",
      "his march from Oenoe to Constantinople, his slender train insensibly\n",
      "swelled to a crowd and an army: his professions of religion and loyalty\n",
      "were mistaken for the language of his heart; and the simplicity of a\n",
      "foreign dress, which showed to advantage his majestic stature, displayed\n",
      "a lively image of his poverty and exile. All opposition sunk before him;\n",
      "he reached the straits of the Thracian Bosphorus; the Byzantine navy\n",
      "sailed from the harbor to receive and transport the savior of the\n",
      "empire: the torrent was loud and irresistible, and the insects who had\n",
      "basked in the sunshine of royal favor disappeared at the blast of the\n",
      "storm. It was the first care of Andronicus to occupy the palace, to\n",
      "salute the emperor, to confine his mother, to punish her minister,\n",
      "and to restore the public order and tranquillity. He then visited the\n",
      "sepulchre of Manuel: the spectators were ordered to stand aloof, but as\n",
      "he bowed in the attitude of prayer, they heard, or thought they heard, a\n",
      "murmur of triumph or revenge: \"I no longer fear thee, my old enemy, who\n",
      "hast driven me a vagabond to every climate of the earth. Thou art safety\n",
      "deposited under a seven-fold dome, from whence thou canst never arise\n",
      "till the signal of the last trumpet. It is now my turn, and speedily\n",
      "will I trample on thy ashes and thy posterity.\" From his subsequent\n",
      "tyranny we may impute such feelings to the man and the moment; but it\n",
      "is not extremely probable that he gave an articulate sound to his secret\n",
      "thoughts. In the first months of his administration, his designs were\n",
      "veiled by a fair semblance of hypocrisy, which could delude only the\n",
      "eyes of the multitude; the coronation of Alexius was performed with due\n",
      "solemnity, and his perfidious guardian, holding in his hands the body\n",
      "and blood of Christ, most fervently declared that he lived, and was\n",
      "ready to die, for the service of his beloved pupil. But his numerous\n",
      "adherents were instructed to maintain, that the sinking empire must\n",
      "perish in the hands of a child, that the Romans could only be saved by a\n",
      "veteran prince, bold in arms, skilful in policy, and taught to reign by\n",
      "the long experience of fortune and mankind; and that it was the duty of\n",
      "every citizen to force the reluctant modesty of Andronicus to undertake\n",
      "the burden of the public care. The young emperor was himself constrained\n",
      "to join his voice to the general acclamation, and to solicit the\n",
      "association of a colleague, who instantly degraded him from the supreme\n",
      "rank, secluded his person, and verified the rash declaration of the\n",
      "patriarch, that Alexius might be considered as dead, so soon as he was\n",
      "committed to the custody of his guardian. But his death was preceded\n",
      "by the imprisonment and execution of his mother. After blackening her\n",
      "reputation, and inflaming against her the passions of the multitude, the\n",
      "tyrant accused and tried the empress for a treasonable correspondence\n",
      "with the king of Hungary. His own son, a youth of honor and humanity,\n",
      "avowed his abhorrence of this flagitious act, and three of the judges\n",
      "had the merit of preferring their conscience to their safety: but the\n",
      "obsequious tribunal, without requiring any reproof, or hearing any\n",
      "defence, condemned the widow of Manuel; and her unfortunate son\n",
      "subscribed the sentence of her death. Maria was strangled, her corpse\n",
      "was buried in the sea, and her memory was wounded by the insult most\n",
      "offensive to female vanity, a false and ugly representation of her\n",
      "beauteous form. The fate of her son was not long deferred: he was\n",
      "strangled with a bowstring; and the tyrant, insensible to pity or\n",
      "remorse, after surveying the body of the innocent youth, struck it\n",
      "rudely with his foot: \"Thy father,\" he cried, \"was a _knave_, thy mother\n",
      "a _whore_, and thyself a _fool_!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Roman sceptre, the reward of his crimes, was held by Andronicus\n",
      "about three years and a half as the guardian or sovereign of the empire.\n",
      "His government exhibited a singular contrast of vice and virtue. When\n",
      "he listened to his passions, he was the scourge; when he consulted his\n",
      "reason, the father, of his people. In the exercise of private justice,\n",
      "he was equitable and rigorous: a shameful and pernicious venality\n",
      "was abolished, and the offices were filled with the most deserving\n",
      "candidates, by a prince who had sense to choose, and severity to punish.\n",
      "He prohibited the inhuman practice of pillaging the goods and persons of\n",
      "shipwrecked mariners; the provinces, so long the objects of oppression\n",
      "or neglect, revived in prosperity and plenty; and millions applauded the\n",
      "distant blessings of his reign, while he was cursed by the witnesses of\n",
      "his daily cruelties. The ancient proverb, That bloodthirsty is the man\n",
      "who returns from banishment to power, had been applied, with too much\n",
      "truth, to 'Marius and Tiberius; and was now verified for the third time\n",
      "in the life of Andronicus. His memory was stored with a black list\n",
      "of the enemies and rivals, who had traduced his merit, opposed his\n",
      "greatness, or insulted his misfortunes; and the only comfort of\n",
      "his exile was the sacred hope and promise of revenge. The necessary\n",
      "extinction of the young emperor and his mother imposed the fatal\n",
      "obligation of extirpating the friends, who hated, and might punish, the\n",
      "assassin; and the repetition of murder rendered him less willing, and\n",
      "less able, to forgive. A horrid narrative of the victims whom he\n",
      "sacrificed by poison or the sword, by the sea or the flames, would be\n",
      "less expressive of his cruelty than the appellation of the halcyon days,\n",
      "which was applied to a rare and bloodless week of repose: the tyrant\n",
      "strove to transfer, on the laws and the judges, some portion of his\n",
      "guilt; but the mask was fallen, and his subjects could no longer mistake\n",
      "the true author of their calamities. The noblest of the Greeks,\n",
      "more especially those who, by descent or alliance, might dispute the\n",
      "Comnenian inheritance, escaped from the monster's den: Nice and Prusa,\n",
      "Sicily or Cyprus, were their places of refuge; and as their flight was\n",
      "already criminal, they aggravated their offence by an open revolt, and\n",
      "the Imperial title. Yet Andronicus resisted the daggers and swords of\n",
      "his most formidable enemies: Nice and Prusa were reduced and chastised:\n",
      "the Sicilians were content with the sack of Thessalonica; and the\n",
      "distance of Cyprus was not more propitious to the rebel than to the\n",
      "tyrant. His throne was subverted by a rival without merit, and a people\n",
      "without arms. Isaac Angelus, a descendant in the female line from the\n",
      "great Alexius, was marked as a victim by the prudence or superstition\n",
      "of the emperor. In a moment of despair, Angelus defended his life and\n",
      "liberty, slew the executioner, and fled to the church of St. Sophia. The\n",
      "sanctuary was insensibly filled with a curious and mournful crowd, who,\n",
      "in his fate, prognosticated their own. But their lamentations were soon\n",
      "turned to curses, and their curses to threats: they dared to ask, \"Why\n",
      "do we fear? why do we obey? We are many, and he is one: our patience is\n",
      "the only bond of our slavery.\" With the dawn of day the city burst into\n",
      "a general sedition, the prisons were thrown open, the coldest and most\n",
      "servile were roused to the defence of their country, and Isaac, the\n",
      "second of the name, was raised from the sanctuary to the throne.\n",
      "Unconscious of his danger, the tyrant was absent; withdrawn from the\n",
      "toils of state, in the delicious islands of the Propontis. He had\n",
      "contracted an indecent marriage with Alice, or Agnes, daughter of Lewis\n",
      "the Seventh, of France, and relict of the unfortunate Alexius; and his\n",
      "society, more suitable to his temper than to his age, was composed of\n",
      "a young wife and a favorite concubine. On the first alarm, he rushed\n",
      "to Constantinople, impatient for the blood of the guilty; but he was\n",
      "astonished by the silence of the palace, the tumult of the city, and the\n",
      "general desertion of mankind. Andronicus proclaimed a free pardon to his\n",
      "subjects; they neither desired, nor would grant, forgiveness; he offered\n",
      "to resign the crown to his son Manuel; but the virtues of the son could\n",
      "not expiate his father's crimes. The sea was still open for his retreat;\n",
      "but the news of the revolution had flown along the coast; when fear had\n",
      "ceased, obedience was no more: the Imperial galley was pursued and taken\n",
      "by an armed brigantine; and the tyrant was dragged to the presence of\n",
      "Isaac Angelus, loaded with fetters, and a long chain round his neck. His\n",
      "eloquence, and the tears of his female companions, pleaded in vain for\n",
      "his life; but, instead of the decencies of a legal execution, the new\n",
      "monarch abandoned the criminal to the numerous sufferers, whom he had\n",
      "deprived of a father, a husband, or a friend. His teeth and hair, an eye\n",
      "and a hand, were torn from him, as a poor compensation for their loss:\n",
      "and a short respite was allowed, that he might feel the bitterness\n",
      "of death. Astride on a camel, without any danger of a rescue, he was\n",
      "carried through the city, and the basest of the populace rejoiced to\n",
      "trample on the fallen majesty of their prince. After a thousand blows\n",
      "and outrages, Andronicus was hung by the feet, between two pillars, that\n",
      "supported the statues of a wolf and an a sow; and every hand that could\n",
      "reach the public enemy, inflicted on his body some mark of ingenious or\n",
      "brutal cruelty, till two friendly or furious Italians, plunging their\n",
      "swords into his body, released him from all human punishment. In this\n",
      "long and painful agony, \"Lord, have mercy upon me!\" and \"Why will you\n",
      "bruise a broken reed?\" were the only words that escaped from his mouth.\n",
      "Our hatred for the tyrant is lost in pity for the man; nor can we blame\n",
      "his pusillanimous resignation, since a Greek Christian was no longer\n",
      "master of his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been tempted to expatiate on the extraordinary character and\n",
      "adventures of Andronicus; but I shall here terminate the series of the\n",
      "Greek emperors since the time of Heraclius. The branches that sprang\n",
      "from the Comnenian trunk had insensibly withered; and the male line\n",
      "was continued only in the posterity of Andronicus himself, who, in the\n",
      "public confusion, usurped the sovereignty of Trebizond, so obscure in\n",
      "history, and so famous in romance. A private citizen of Philadelphia,\n",
      "Constantine Angelus, had emerged to wealth and honors, by his\n",
      "marriage with a daughter of the emperor Alexius. His son Andronicus\n",
      "is conspicuous only by his cowardice. His grandson Isaac punished and\n",
      "succeeded the tyrant; but he was dethroned by his own vices, and the\n",
      "ambition of his brother; and their discord introduced the Latins to the\n",
      "conquest of Constantinople, the first great period in the fall of the\n",
      "Eastern empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we compute the number and duration of the reigns, it will be\n",
      "found, that a period of six hundred years is filled by sixty emperors,\n",
      "including in the Augustan list some female sovereigns; and deducting\n",
      "some usurpers who were never acknowledged in the capital, and some\n",
      "princes who did not live to possess their inheritance. The average\n",
      "proportion will allow ten years for each emperor, far below the\n",
      "chronological rule of Sir Isaac Newton, who, from the experience of\n",
      "more recent and regular monarchies, has defined about eighteen or twenty\n",
      "years as the term of an ordinary reign. The Byzantine empire was\n",
      "most tranquil and prosperous when it could acquiesce in hereditary\n",
      "succession; five dynasties, the Heraclian, Isaurian, Amorian, Basilian,\n",
      "and Comnenian families, enjoyed and transmitted the royal patrimony\n",
      "during their respective series of five, four, three, six, and four\n",
      "generations; several princes number the years of their reign with those\n",
      "of their infancy; and Constantine the Seventh and his two grandsons\n",
      "occupy the space of an entire century. But in the intervals of the\n",
      "Byzantine dynasties, the succession is rapid and broken, and the name\n",
      "of a successful candidate is speedily erased by a more fortunate\n",
      "competitor. Many were the paths that led to the summit of royalty:\n",
      "the fabric of rebellion was overthrown by the stroke of conspiracy, or\n",
      "undermined by the silent arts of intrigue: the favorites of the soldiers\n",
      "or people, of the senate or clergy, of the women and eunuchs, were\n",
      "alternately clothed with the purple: the means of their elevation were\n",
      "base, and their end was often contemptible or tragic. A being of the\n",
      "nature of man, endowed with the same faculties, but with a longer\n",
      "measure of existence, would cast down a smile of pity and contempt on\n",
      "the crimes and follies of human ambition, so eager, in a narrow span,\n",
      "to grasp at a precarious and short-lived enjoyment. It is thus that\n",
      "the experience of history exalts and enlarges the horizon of our\n",
      "intellectual view. In a composition of some days, in a perusal of some\n",
      "hours, six hundred years have rolled away, and the duration of a life or\n",
      "reign is contracted to a fleeting moment: the grave is ever beside the\n",
      "throne: the success of a criminal is almost instantly followed by the\n",
      "loss of his prize and our immortal reason survives and disdains the\n",
      "sixty phantoms of kings who have passed before our eyes, and faintly\n",
      "dwell on our remembrance. The observation that, in every age and\n",
      "climate, ambition has prevailed with the same commanding energy, may\n",
      "abate the surprise of a philosopher: but while he condemns the vanity,\n",
      "he may search the motive, of this universal desire to obtain and hold\n",
      "the sceptre of dominion. To the greater part of the Byzantine series,\n",
      "we cannot reasonably ascribe the love of fame and of mankind. The virtue\n",
      "alone of John Comnenus was beneficent and pure: the most illustrious of\n",
      "the princes, who precede or follow that respectable name, have trod\n",
      "with some dexterity and vigor the crooked and bloody paths of a selfish\n",
      "policy: in scrutinizing the imperfect characters of Leo the Isaurian,\n",
      "Basil the First, and Alexius Comnenus, of Theophilus, the second Basil,\n",
      "and Manuel Comnenus, our esteem and censure are almost equally balanced;\n",
      "and the remainder of the Imperial crowd could only desire and expect to\n",
      "be forgotten by posterity. Was personal happiness the aim and object of\n",
      "their ambition? I shall not descant on the vulgar topics of the misery\n",
      "of kings; but I may surely observe, that their condition, of all others,\n",
      "is the most pregnant with fear, and the least susceptible of hope. For\n",
      "these opposite passions, a larger scope was allowed in the revolutions\n",
      "of antiquity, than in the smooth and solid temper of the modern world,\n",
      "which cannot easily repeat either the triumph of Alexander or the fall\n",
      "of Darius. But the peculiar infelicity of the Byzantine princes exposed\n",
      "them to domestic perils, without affording any lively promise of foreign\n",
      "conquest. From the pinnacle of greatness, Andronicus was precipitated\n",
      "by a death more cruel and shameful than that of the malefactor; but\n",
      "the most glorious of his predecessors had much more to dread from\n",
      "their subjects than to hope from their enemies. The army was licentious\n",
      "without spirit, the nation turbulent without freedom: the Barbarians of\n",
      "the East and West pressed on the monarchy, and the loss of the provinces\n",
      "was terminated by the final servitude of the capital.\n",
